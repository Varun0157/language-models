come monsieur come and both set off towards the capital at full gallop				885.724153845695
gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me here a long time incognito no my lord replied the gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here then you will be besieged we expect it and what shall you do defend ourselves				2131.9585694613356

the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone				8406.883441385566
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo				265.2087606848547

his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol but the comte de la fere asked the king				266.2495514800344
whoever did it writes well				536.5660292564296
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you				105.62569007997342
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed				638.6422171811297
the meeting chapter				221.1387559545149
which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				769.8020646078442
monsieur de beaufort escaped my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace and you did not fire on him he was out of range monsieur de chavigny where was he absent and la ramee was found locked up in the prisoner s room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him but the man who was under him was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him mazarin groaned				3246.8966453913063

when he came up again the light had disappeared				581.9560891231504
we are friends are we not egad				2777.9304282856087
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past yes well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some time then scarcely longer than eight or ten days and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days				1858.8207554033722
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment				8235.24284131026
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week about one o clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door				243.82236156414612
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity				17886.072400397326
he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious				3819.1191187373447
everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose				11714.400107948282
they don t burn sorcerers nowadays no				473.7080129678688

oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day				472.7674734817004
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts				5338.015195552883
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents				19743.737301782257
porthos murmured the comte de la fere				3582.188379225107
you are a precious creature my pretty hostess and i am much obliged to you the next moment d artagnan was on his way to notre dame				2232.4832035656423
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone				2801.731925098955
he seemed to be quite overcome				6086.706556665577
i came to pray over the body of your daughter and now why are you here i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni no the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face				783.7235168842866
am i not to know to whom to present it you will know when you reach london at london you may tear off the outer envelope and what are my instructions to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed				2728.3642658994795
a light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers				5364.603888557959
oh yes				500.24973360926384

do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back				1092.480724755094

he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury				8137.514236519207
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo				643.8534401138447
i am not yet twenty one and eugénie is only seventeen but the two months expire next week				4318.941750361377
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses one s self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection				5363.887684478334

at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him				55.09828315578934

before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs go laporte said the queen				210.39016542359215
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat				1780.6098023314084
i shall then have no more friends said the young man				144.30946667466816
salute my hero viscount and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten				1989.4841156665586
the captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so i took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then i jumped after him				51.280604614476935
andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle				13156.216429744025
friend said he for athos this is too much for the comte de la fère it is too little				995.33277208323

but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down				789.2901482886623
this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box				2116.7024486436917
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachman s voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows				1764.6001461000692
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter				23500.688643041474

let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis				21.138327381655508

i have no greater regard for the bastille than you				130.73785581586006
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice				20773.98568570127
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window				609.5315062194522

he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux				11535.359109036892
through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park				3422.2578469407085
deuce take it				59.39470913524495
you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests				2569.3543280667095
a better idea however came into her mind before going to bed				752.3799316030165
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships				7476.153106278632
more dead than alive he looked around him				47.005720996255135
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time				441.42316239405665
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath				4172.781184555948
be content i will depart but you will not follow me you will not watch me i will return home instantly ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme				74.6847775982072
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father				719.3192253998152
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips				522.0517514267566
now i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm				1350.7355042224583
still he had not even uttered a sigh				1519.676766057744
it is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back				1011.4824307814546
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess				34754.031991785385
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair				840.2518815969564
ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation danglars was quite annoyed by the young man s indifference				4283.893163119482
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day				491.5127258510036
not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes				22168.39703195174
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted				2445.102229464964
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished				24466.768004765265
porthos chapter xxvi				4347.347827371588
in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted man to make a journey to london for her				161.7496155775082
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion				7689.300575526716
what is that line				4462.503770404432
albert could not understand the banker s look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can i tell you because i imagine you have correspondents in that country monte cristo smiled significantly				30753.565422427448
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair				855.6387113143712
a flurry in stocks chapter				240.77201240505846
on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them				127.75207317999183
and you are not afraid of that athos no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest and with regard to the past asked porthos				60.89455330266333
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin				1387.9582028665286
years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined				4640.517535194265
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france				488.95910787442523
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god				739.5330844390811
i am incredulous the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal				409.6423812695595
i am hungry that is all pardieu if that is all i am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips				553.8836312189525
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination				2681.8504826709172
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold				2084.868000381155
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them				112.67948653658085
and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready				922.7736717441385
hush said athos				8.698366854326942
here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel				7857.76390693441
what have i to do with politics				7994.93649827053
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so				232.87224485867037
i possess nearly livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint méran will leave me as much and m noirtier evidently intends making me his heir				3401.923515845785
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us				551.6926745730347
galloping through the bushes the count				333.4629246430536
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father				623.0047231361352
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me				87.07968141966653
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words				795.0839633773553
quick said a voice at the end of the gallery				6663.838765956433
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle s place and cardinal like mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal				2213.9525375063954
well i have ten thousand for you you are not boasting do you wish for a proof yes there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis				2154.9921386732362
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money				733.5016292098694
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society				4430.5725717687665
yes i know that said d artagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him				57.86402907434443
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctor s niece hold your tongue porthos said athos you are insupportable will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise he took you for buckingham cried d artagnan				369.7143549439062
and you will tell him i will publish the report of bois robert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade				16345.623576947071
arrived there he fastened according to the orders of his master both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator s door then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed				13054.31946539548
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there				628.7394883025152
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar				19983.53941817151
to prison with him				45.708987906856315
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards				4540.531049140378
six of his eminence s guards arrest six of his majesty s musketeers				1107.7382125760887
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion				2429.7743798718743
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side				910.0902737732249
in the king s name cried comminges				383.33536641201636
come now you don t really wish it but he is dead i am sure of it he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave peste				7582.791369086246
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the stranger				1343.1073765572985
i was present during his last moments				5371.581646404664
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city				1506.301181986601
and have you any recollection of your country when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again				592.5979875496957
what is his name count albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome in what language would you like me to converse with him monte cristo turned to albert				632.2579300965874
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform				1498.709689463337
even ali who had hastened to obey the count s summons went forth from his master s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master s happy reverie				4947.834495167876
you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow				1153.084372363751
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them				105.41843508079238
thank god				313.6787010333793
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you d artagnan became more and more astonished				2471.8124533825107
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still				3631.3475529634675
and will you not torment me any more never caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change				5286.23059414177
of course you stopped at your father s a feeling of faintness came over villefort				525.1867381125032
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion				9797.03036469173
the place royale be it so replied athos				8.814117053014835
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder				3070.3731089773055
he put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning				1462.8944395885158
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble				1783.7600545828375
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister				1562.3266430416118
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting				2946.57298814218
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once				1230.7339553304926
the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps				1190.377220575082
recollect the ancient romans of the circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men				371.4582961065797
i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey orders i have taken an oath to obey and i do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent that most sacred in the world said athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty				12713.072164445304

for different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the rue de la monnaie of the sign of the hermitage				30641.353021820807
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor				6347.743069786149
a mattress was laid upon the deck for him				57.111489952283414
who s up there said the man				84.56810790821294
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell				15525.483305549658
but for the honor of the king of the queen well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen				243.81213058534658
and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread i have formed a plan caderousse s plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas ideas were but the germ the plan was reality				2704.955159690168
his devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile				7946.765332313018
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis				723.4483812895116
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend s arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service yes it s true				1539.8442147952849
i have an idea said d artagnan				1.1425998148581948
come speak monsieur de cavois monsieur de cavois in person the captain of the cardinal s guards himself did he come to arrest me i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling manner was he so sweet then indeed he was all honey monsieur indeed he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palais royal it was called the palais cardinal before richelieu gave it to the king				265.1782852405552
a bottle perhaps a whole bottle				12497.117394660781
i don t know such a place and that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried athos				22.59658537444706
madame said he				8.133548787337592
monsieur said d artagnan you must excuse famished travelers				16039.624310482252
you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask				3310.626517637526
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune				1388.422885327722
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i don t know my way				783.7119320065775
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure				4569.161202771031
of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story				2674.721679380619
pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true				1854.3801124090573
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath				3226.22866339658
open sir she said and look for yourself mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze				6667.869137886336
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp				1809.0824564926318
nothing at least personally said monte cristo				43.074178786605366
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him				51.65318944294821
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dantès				426.3585612948928
this time it was mordaunt who smiled				531.0648935966077
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				1685.957611669494
but his majesty s decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it				103.1754788935442
well did there not happen an event which saved austria				1761.2342868821427
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach				3683.0916371122016
the cardinal s replied mme				82.94447481449286
it was the island of monte cristo				136.89644157447125
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf				757.7886132058602
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses				5619.194233234422
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose				4107.218553898038
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked caderousse				74.92008301517694
good he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the breast				1012.111561736489
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm				1350.022051096103
well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him				54.149684535341336
then raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he can t cry out oh said porthos				37.374302233466075
the scotch my brothers				6292.814919651582
chapter viii				2996.3176115711026
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them				112.84068356827693
listen morrel it is noon if valentine is not now dead she will not die how so cried morrel when i left her dying monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead				1446.8036272235418
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of england				1594.228992095757
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for i am aware that m de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman				1343.0670292225436
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never				3423.79866926598
they searched they questioned				5007.418561677772
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king ah you knew that said mordaunt				281.46039930349974
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her				135.14647573761354
my lord he said which way do we go				816.8284335462787
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us no on the faith of a cardinal				289.96375594471414
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in rita s left breast				1053.5838598558496
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city				1438.6110139505497
on the king s service the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received				3469.8046044593675
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion				2014.6495730073714
porthos succeeded him and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight				3947.075671956989
i am dying with anxiety				1965.3750995726166
calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile				386.1634329004679
if i were a frondeur said d artagnan i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper				2683.393166191762
in he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos				497.9376995813362
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk				2882.962571901758
dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall				898.583286497899
at the door they found the carriage				998.218314044839
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence				9739.23643955687
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor				2273.915551989149
he watched the effect of this question on the old man				358.95321597504085
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do				1203.0188419934072
their vows were sacred and irrevocable				39771.96663847725
the duke counted two stories				3998.5110368554456
must we then asked anne of austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously				5317.893931100501
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement				48366.00303194676
answer me on what i could get you lie repeated the abbé a third time with a still more imperative tone				1018.7542248260515
i thought you had softened				7720.0287869176045
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture				4355.50641884986
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled				4379.831905962854
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient it is possible said morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt				21763.08254849488
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them				113.30431666031117
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions				2908.839965940217
a tailor said the host and for what to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert				478.80903410853574
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example				1311.9004898988828
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack				1954.3690529037601
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it				63.49922362483547
let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks				3817.039991070893
see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them				116.64089720612228
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen private interests are as nothing before the interests of all				402.0723707476543
at six in the evening the guests began to come				1422.201930812178
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out				244.11435780939416
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health				3801.16536242718
we must be expeditious				65808.19068175243
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				20807.553844390546
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat				1885.4280786167024
the second was the man s conventional abode or rather sleeping place it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed a table two chairs a stone pitcher and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes				23377.700749617696
we are going then we two with our swords you with daggers				37709.85749289181
at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber				723.147632534562
i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion				2877.6967729095018
i really believe you are a man and a violent one too and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal				52674.17262123863
aramis shuddered				4452.857856499241
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them				100.49906559267713
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan				12232.619836450069
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his				1043.2042460205741
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel long live the coadjutor long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness				2833.618585271149
people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world				602.4041088812636
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it to morrow raoul didn t wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse				862.6514427586973
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage				1191.6590197187352
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo				42.3570550522202
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris write to him now s the time you are sure of your enterprise yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them				102.86486904430707
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of d artagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders				23116.715129552507
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum				2314.200374235209
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed				16768.777280533184
i know what i am saying continued the marchioness i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage				3305.5283158406414
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château renaud				978.7061286312901
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side				909.4660125386386
an instant after dantès entered				382.16511617011446
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman				10262.794409932803
to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph				3791.957969177575
yes you talk like a child i repeat the word				709.5134737080575
these were the first words he had spoken				3432.563841211886
adieu au revoir				50649.20405082424
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess				2772.8181294118435
we must proceed in an orderly manner hush said grimaud he is coming out				210.4059165434056
yes there is the sky here is the sea				860.044177418119
simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton				516.3922768108336
before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die				1985.819974664628
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board				8122.364264844501
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries				19909.238171012403
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved				5733.581452060644
indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you				196.689476658963
how badly				10632.263746929188
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening				737.4656487217328
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price				5381.677796622582
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head				337.1125757829805
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos				16.40926441806368
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes				18037.085150750474
what a dreadful death what a blow				1529.8877388084238
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this moment				762.6104574575779
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly the conduct is infamously violent				31700.994045018484
where are you going asked dantès				129.9295001434245
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving england in case either of failure or of success				2501.7413720523828
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close				4163.026973186209
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtier s expression could not be understood				4617.407556903982
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand				203.96265171973286
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort				116.09876616398336
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage				5176.140772438481
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration				4370.789838163
your hand dantès				446.0718687132057
and her mother madame de saint remy have they yet told her of it no sir madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans				9127.335081942443
d artagnan lost no time in useless compliments				4829.366180131543
they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish i prefer my own specific undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you but i said monte cristo rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you how kind you are only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison				34451.68920325224
besides kitty will tell nothing will you kitty				1248.1656768903053
it would quite cut me up you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus				857.8058929918825

mazarin is almost king answered athos madame henrietta is almost no longer queen if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture athos smiled				552.9499896846304
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation				34586.76019307642
come said he to himself be a man				330.9161767506439

at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina				5409.010108044699
what story can i invent				50513.31754762963

in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder				2343.840916267628
after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind				671.0639263962912
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say				683.9037896331072
the brand of england it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of france oh by that by that i was branded indeed this was too much for felton				1533.7136741385011
at the same moment whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase				1730.6957961926144
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants				2705.8194792476565
you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy				3786.049937515047
why i do not know				727.7934742451463
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal				450.4871838818238
this unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in paris on the tenth of january and the prince of conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of paris				541.084148912963
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals				35852.31948662347
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself adieu gentlemen said de comminges sleep well we will try de comminges went away d artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted				23022.178087551736
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded				4866.85347588559
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moment s pause				4344.504633089435
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man				239.53880284193892
this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then by no means				1616.6110177231385
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning				2613.245257557254

however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other				606.3031473037423
he lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to heaven and recognized friquet				4236.088534483028
come my dear bazin tell me where he is didn t you hear me tell you monsieur d artagnan that i don t know where he is yes certainly but to that i answer that it is impossible it is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good god d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided				6338.227770756818
lord winter is killed then inquired d artagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse				2220.856968533987
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made				1427.56063893069
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinal s party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments				3232.320260946091
d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it				106.32039995570106
that was a superb throw so i left off there d artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast				943.3584213553697
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone				767.7979050920137
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him				48.47712666450601

the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone				3831.6578841754094
yes raoul replied the count				104.77897007886747
why said aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot well i said d artagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot				8328.599231389511
ah it is you peppino said the count				105.39812899624921
stay sir said anne to him				57.65361185122747
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence				2966.726579781828
what more do you want i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person absolutely then as i said before sir very well i am ready to marry m cavalcanti but what are you up to ah that is my affair				1143.9484348551932
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m morrel left on old dantès chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt				6425.564098678517
the noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern				6627.447329356241

how asked blaisois i can				2083.8273929320667
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second				3089.8776218442717
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror				1040.162375873302
we can talk of it afterward then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed				1855.0947138357847
they could willingly have strangled m de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus				897.5790673757356
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped but athos cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty				2371.756613094341
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out				246.10899280321115
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud s hands but grimaud shook his head				358.96913441552
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror				5665.5457631486715
at the outer door the steward paused				2358.5254490151683
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one				729.2977053562738
emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his cries				5459.1957682372895
why watch me asked the duke uneasily				1094.1729903949542
that will be for another time he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah				235.62839220919233
oh my god my god				319.5614712613488
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes				35550.11714588127
d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour				1149.5795726941583
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i resisted				5616.8582467104725

we have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides i don t prevent you from listening but i must be gone you must be gone said porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make you will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe				16014.557530628734
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you				84.15357585408815
we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now my lord said athos do not let us disturb you				73.87481553683035
but this annoys you let us change the subject				1453.2331559038096
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him				53.278278594106
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m de tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions				5117.5399051922095
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating				21972.567241277968
how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand and i can set out immediately when you like raoul sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince and you ought to thank her raoul				530.6310321703809
of what nature why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination				2979.894945844302
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be				1150.229328523834
let us see said athos				8.214880921144044
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting				4073.056778843183

go said he quickly				2273.438515564898
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room				193.47275833298445
what can i do for you valentine valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes				675.8451834299702
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments				3352.4698487701726
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle				4724.202237844501

all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted d artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint				11557.822944051799
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box				2395.225916675924
gendarmes i am at your service				1047.7277826139275
i love her and i ask god and you how i can save her monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion				6433.019941860594
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter				712.4436279921633
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable				21896.862995505337
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile				417.9469933255958
the life of the four young men had become fraternal				50464.58973284283
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers				7188.964559865487
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her				143.60853395820408
well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy				4108.958047438082
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct				6506.1010817904935
so much the better to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door				203.00962723291678
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich				26449.8637652523
well here s the case here s where the saddle hurts me as we french say				901.7278047880263
just then a patrol rode up				1132.4814539478023
what had become of him he cared not to inquire				12929.009828768894
yes he is young and youth is invariably self confident				8274.77103061553
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding				38809.50830959181
the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter take him alive no				432.4239658436286
we can not say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly				10347.588157590968
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform				1425.2290575998559
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back i am paid the duke went from one surprise to another				845.1421297900467
the daughter of ali pasha of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki and your slave ma foi yes but how did she become so why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople wonderful				27638.472075547787
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at boulogne i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness				2832.1124259825674
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man				364.6674574173306
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis				273.68232623431805
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do my father my father cried the young man why should you not live if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagements in fact only a bankrupt				8070.8926086256615
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her				145.9648752921085
i can not cry at my age they say that we have no more tears still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping				8368.631386754494
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might fail for felton was forewarned and that against the least chance				13667.195009668696
come in here monsieur chevalier said she here we shall be alone and can talk and whose room is this my dear child it is mine monsieur chevalier it communicates with my mistress s by that door				343.68498425682685
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him				47.004432204644246
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass				1311.5683580479686
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw d artagnan who stood expecting her				126.42421042655057
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer				1380.897290220249
i am willing to help rebuild your fortune but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others but since i tell you cried danglars that with these three million do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit shall you be able to pay m cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry he shall receive them on returning from the mayor very well what next				3413.8901258208416
they have vexed you and you are angry the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent				2227.551364601189
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia				32637.962767108424
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived				1824.756812073182
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat				3563.1424042632943
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling				19609.511125328412
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				1357.6913925861188
all this is very sad which you tell me what will you				73.65094032053207
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace				2258.9217994984265
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said d artagnan				37.43131195413904
go to sleep soon louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early i will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but i have no inclination to sleep laporte said anne of austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress yourself the king went out accompanied by the chevalier de coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment				824.9812357078656
fie d artagnan d artagnan cried aramis you are killing me well here it is at last said d artagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket				903.0875573155421
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				68.55960900549553
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath				3295.069480181824
if i m not mistaken here s bazin				2180.7667459847726
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor				2415.729944582133
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt				789.9483048400828
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence				1024.922309613319
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion				5833.394132032026
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god				446.7428146799968
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard				5713.500041836597
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love				776.4855270320473
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her son s ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss				2975.5046841178905
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask				4763.475528608003
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter				801.8729723707663
this instant sir this instant i beseech you said the old lady				4150.001408559934
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed				48854.70967828246
m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character				3233.6614617789573
de bernet were exiled and laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant				1630.8323661904114
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him				52.80828699012354
stop in the name of heaven monsieur porthos cried she				58.9083618506549
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality				3909.85097909528
what is the matter				963.1900091150859
believe me dear albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feeling believe me i feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way i can serve you i am yours thank you sir said albert smiling				220.28880217104907
at the same time the door was opened				1640.6851772079326
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene				3049.7030124168655
well my lord				449.15604960243
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer				4635.3469588743465
indeed you could not belong to him				43.22368698014805
then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it				89.00192078515957
help me here i am sir said athos leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here i am take my hand and jump into our boat mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair				1289.8171769372557
i tell you the queen does not love me i tell you she loves another i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham				1056.3606941563319
d artagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility				33161.042595328516
as to felton he hesitates				27980.058026748236
with regard to d artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet				1216.3061502473367
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment				1297.8566201338044
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable				13792.804377432394
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad				25296.951628567338
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise				21035.426671946207
she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last				2273.1967830460735
he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it				102.3950671542734
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now athos come athos was about to retire				3649.508410430034
the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade				7779.509296746319
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned d artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game				4081.965598439533
i have doubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter				2206.2214899714463
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely				41659.20381562146
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign				3920.9372497702366
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner				809.6872976783069
but m de tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful				50407.83207046713
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head				345.89858663462616
the glance was of sublime eloquence				31693.013689777865
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger				5919.698978127138
give the watchword do you want money money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag				5674.792577048697
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count s pistol				3964.629527799321
have you wanted money father i want nothing now that i have you said the old man				85.30672576202586
the good george said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy				4176.364248839677
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner				3357.618035113716
that is to say when you have received my instructions				3727.164280502099
have you not slept said the jailer				10935.100917562087
however what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that subject with pleasure replied d artagnan i must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life how go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside ah				304.25058018288263
certainly it is empty replied the procurator s wife in real innocence				5192.09987047414
you have decided friend said athos				8.449962040899203
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years i ll answer for it without any attempt to escape still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead there was a moment of complete silence during which dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time				427.038136348976
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england				1177.3159050813038
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right				1004.2563169905466
you wish to make me believe something too dreadful				41970.44802632125
i think not replied château renaud				284.41176075130153
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength				1549.8617921475218
it is true he had been playing the day before playing the day before				832.2727356676394
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window				610.3787500065093
i shall be gone only a few moments villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace				2628.7175052881253
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars				170.8615201952217
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them you are mistaken friend d artagnan said aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder ah indeed said d artagnan				97.55954724840255
at this order given in athos s habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos s brow grew smooth				68998.29823788197
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place				668.3259482266449
is he a deputy oh no				370.2575614261354

everyone is free to ask what he pleases that s true replied jacopo i only make a remark well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them no said jacopo but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers that is all i want interrupted dantès				369.45547041168135
send him away or you will never make a man of him i think i shall send him to paris so thought d artagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived				1798.9439240932825
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another				930.6081692712405
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow				4539.383694349586
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety				3300.456850335002
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return well we will settle our account ah monseigneur cried d artagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure				15425.273637722083
the queen entered				577.6404224543677
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued				2784.473799915892
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly				1990.1577782617594
you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince				1003.6502546635153
d artagnan				1.2738170634713586
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more				968.8401035774214
villefort approached noirtier				368.6927376209683
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends				561.3235459874269
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door				286.7586328825749
did you really think me capable of that at least said the abbé i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been				3049.2115284637816
he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house				382.2028397511299
well said the landlord				110032.17887338164
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant				4541.72633828702
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease				3491.203854567923
all london was crowding to the doors of the house				385.88106991139796

courage cried raoul courage too late murmured the young man too late the water closed above his head and stifled his voice				577.8112207593009
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned				44801.68332075978
the baroness then thought of m de villefort				294.0388806240032
when i look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge villefort dropped his head and sighed				2881.8850056480574
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests				2663.5038347934724
we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets the doctor was right steps were heard in the passage				2161.7704205644095
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn				6475.497242290852
no cried d artagnan no steel				17596.97300239736

cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres that is admirable said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other				586.7503649914577
that is all very simple you had business in england monseigneur said d artagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or elsewhere that concerns nobody				12839.276212763069
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried d artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse				865.46096446303
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened				3106.8382715287576
tis easy to say so but that requires money and i haven t any ah replied mazarin so you have no money none my lord but the diamond i gave you yesterday i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence mazarin sighed				3397.468729731723
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated				17528.001150259464
ah he is not a man like that cursed d artagnan				1.1134963050275541
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point				2373.7365870347917
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology but alas but what the paragraph was correct my friend what				641.2527781946413
but what were you to do with that woman asked d artagnan with anguish				3531.9157863268742
you see your friends are wakeful				45489.59056840512
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m d avrigny no mercy sir				377.50515085946864
that is my answer the answer was terrible				4032.1821639480618
the evening arrived all paris was in expectation				6538.202481586049
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard				987.1181078403162
come this way gentlemen come m villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities he then took villefort s arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest				18808.781909533544
porthos was the first who came to himself				179.40978123860958
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees				2375.3659296512014
the man made no reply				1097.107022166687
he was an italian and therefore superstitious				6969.923390185514
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts				51168.788083393105
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known				1479.6947040812558
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what				675.2083596192028
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter				27103.92148280019
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously				34238.03676530383
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming i follow you cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part				2524.7410347126793
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain				1893.709308620696
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them				99.84410691662553
he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor				2717.7934740629144
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong				2770.519806705969
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned				7212.642718220825
my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered				435.53816693290014
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions				3729.692387614934
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other				622.5978676748422
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded				26036.02221998383
i only ask you one favor and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next speak to the master madame said felton happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing				83271.81833667908
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day				456.5857094455878
you are the king of lackeys				2731.982101023784
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river				2563.025589025107
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in				501.68516191108927
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony				2328.088558721939
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step				1326.9958068438427
why what ails you asked he of edmond				883.5824956653605
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances well said andrea let it be as you wish				2253.9444514540587
listen to me				48.800665491652175
when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him dreadfully				51051.36776901475
leave me i command you carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest				1283.9924776464002
live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions				7347.545154870129
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo				664.7319830386316
was it not i				877.207782825952
my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious				28951.558792922464
wait he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it				108.15884164101857
i see spots of blood on the ground and he set off to follow the two friends				583.7336774829889
and the guardsman d artagnan still my young scapegrace				53457.30844574301
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse and m danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole yes they sent me the order of charles iii returned debray carelessly				7315.850233482055
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there				502.5013333208032
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me				109.40967836806912
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa and the men of his band hum				8588.790776067493
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis				540.81124420657
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal				367.408428503733
chapter vii				754.5204790234696
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection				4034.959490553111
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one other woman who can do it as well				552.5577921924076
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria				1770.893435093547
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man				321.100534226098
now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you thought of inviting m and madame danglars and m and madame de villefort to my country house at auteuil				3932.493718005967
a waiter opened the door				212.8143580116836
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please chapter lxix				11724.168263795309
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa				2269.972168974473
i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work				883.5841809668328
would not that dress please you what do you mean asked mercédès with an angry glance what do you mean				2038.8827022463233
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them				123.2098533808364
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel				4914.72665668084
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked dantès of himself				241.84429853430078
his house has been full ever since				4483.02534685003
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air				815.6032257648264
bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast				942.848453898452
after shutting the gate behind them i pretended to return to the house but i immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge i gained yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everything				1119.2075905442978
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment				659.1314133212812
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers i regard them as invaluable now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety				1804.4947374766875
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words october it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse				2171.0511043320516
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself ah ah				212.50041455486334
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight				2421.7688799305233
chapter li				4541.786977280481
what is that noise demanded milady				50.7906822420051

but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming				9470.086552649394
the cousin was received with resignation that was all				352.98296295157246
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us you re right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate				2431.08048054933
pardon cried felton oh pardon milady read in his eyes love				819.9831807236783
that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance the englishman smiled imperceptibly				6564.537231535044
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol				7873.7718480441
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation				10392.903318688825
well i shall see				945.0467867297975
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion				3936.715090162107
everyone offered his own				1053.5512051462208
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman				3700.897098356974
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again				681.4753253498355
as to aramis he never played				6788.716131094055
yes i should expect so besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them the queen s voice				395.65444997687376
you look at me and you are going to laugh at me no on the contrary i am not inclined to laugh said athos suppressing a sigh				6622.456073027296
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber				730.5315437847531
i have not seen such a one four times in my life				567.4080774872931
d artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own				821.0090198114791
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions				36253.458475429565
immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep				974.1126431641891

dear d artagnan				1.4731311895173005
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me murder screamed patrick				2732.190542668111
you can understand that one of two things must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from a height of ninety feet must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remained poor fellow then you pity him said the count				325.90217247247114
and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your will yes and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently				2158.120306244522

monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the king the musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange				5250.998633841929
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior				6148.929961809556

dantès noticed that the captain of la jeune amélie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so				492.94987972728853

i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier d artagnan lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known d artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos				303.5104236103969

lay him down here we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere				6494.973169944828
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				113.23345447530123
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady				2519.529963112202
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the king				448.88755531898823
come then said d artagnan you are right				1065.9823324958998
grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the diamond				2269.7719324970435
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you the count from the moment of first entering the drawing room had not once lost sight of the expression of the young man s countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these words so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and is seeking you young andrea started and exclaimed my father				567.9792490229863
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds				17430.18558685507
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious				57400.45682464832
what do you say inquired charles rising				7942.067973055165
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon				9271.334946211948

he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous				29273.70081879183
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne				12955.818484982308

d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul				1568.5498645983546
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend				945.1197921642221
but you continued m bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days				1802.1352062758665

what said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom what				727.5214465417159
in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass				1424.144825150948
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy				40723.98561617691
the blade was round and of flexible silver				3353.422739155682
he is gone				2090.069867963804
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight of the order of st michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship				7736.043855845813
no i searched the whole thicket				15474.397123061515
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people				889.8617999722251
let me kill him we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize				57842.379176644696
in the meantime d artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette				13368.265912440775
the captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark				37808.77715667276
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be hungry that s pretty good when i haven t eaten for twenty four hours muttered danglars				322.8526187788491
the king signed the order for release and tréville carried it away without delay				6579.642220842314
a bruise yes i think i received a flower pot upon my head brutes said d artagnan				1.4354001188335272
i feel my head a little confused i will take a turn in the garden go and where shall i find you here in an hour here in an hour				1155.3959869411458
i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration nothing more simple returned the count				575.4413710541545
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars				104.008596325752
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme				246.5116109858187
we did not see her monseigneur said athos				9.670114089865098
in an instant all five were ready				943.6184579739239
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it				60.03812415549965
yez what s the dream said the swiss				12650.267202225821
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband s strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan				44923.4472963684
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes				4550.835580822056
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all				386.6644263083934
just now d artagnan continued you were disguised i mean to say attired as a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered oh				935.9261014436038
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a mésalliance				48530.627418789074
you are right said the latter m				267.59194688480596
good lord said d artagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything				2223.2356676019012
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly				5706.889004223082
yes yes murmured d artagnan that s the place milady s own residence then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all				326.5928894526433
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind				1644.5223392983528
the two young persons obeyed				1190.1093359272534
do you fear he will not understand yes oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrow he knows everything i know said she				387.2321675575094
one day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her ah ah said the doctor i did not know that i had a rival but i hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find				8448.347274171007
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts				41249.634752197555
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner				3077.951678163267
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved and if you wished to die you would choose this death count yes morrel extended his hand				211.2907706448204
you shall see and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor broussel is being arrested				2176.896666004403
let us set off mousqueton recognizing the voice of his master s friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night				978.2796728964928
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder				33993.210480897695
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion d artagnan to be preparing his exordium				39093.831771825535
the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of moccoletti repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd				3557.136273094545
no my lord be assured we shall not d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation				678.1154996874027
what is the matter then with this dear child				1363.6891459600095
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency giovanni obeyed				907.8615598684997
the cold gains upon me				81.76498738563147
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act				1954.438015888575
they returned to the hotel at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight				8011.819839052588
while waiting his assistance i trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her				126.01446402134243
the request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up				1283.6417032684556
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp				168.31983281286853
treat him kindly therefore in the future captain said the young king to d artagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the baron du vallon that was a great honor for d artagnan and for porthos				274.9209737961557
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword				1111.3136184830312
d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you				84.51920756432989
monte cristo bent his head				343.3410047893299
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo yes let the sermon be clear said the curate				4267.692425691732
let us talk a little said she				38.92515283360708
for the present he had no anxiety				2088.6471747812216
give me those papers and leave us the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired				1537.1621172885207
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl so young so rich so beautiful				3553.471032894025
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him				48.823847886990585
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments				15036.19481112151
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit continued he				83.36302775930479
i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me				102.16545324798992
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest				2991.6663398011265
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos				71.70924822349298
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker				3540.72474605799
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself come come enough of such compliments cried porthos				19.37392757338233
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini				6717.897533854188
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life d artagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous				12525.335700479049
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told me it was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy				6530.219919037813
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome				29194.99549366767
i wished to live said athos				8.164584456873847
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred				11111.340271327685
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property				5480.933562601808
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man				277.0684858882561
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly				48927.8664324388
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required				3504.249731670953
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished m de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor				23639.874318493054
this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven				2395.173379147028
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step				1387.2191355472012
you said only imagine and then paused				5752.444098370678
ah i can understand that				548.9729681557583
at length i heard the well known noise of the door which opened and shut i heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed haste				2187.3705442442993
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness				23152.191999175073
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				575.9365868773344
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was				1342.2008146451708
had we not better lower our heads in truth murmured d artagnan to whom m de tréville s recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid and he put his horse into a trot				12952.17408640836
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when d artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand				205.55980212550878
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point				2476.056883330059
we have money a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse				3133.159057528632
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence				9636.214049067125
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward				2884.208322507596
her son said he				7.314904217706933
exactly my daughter that is precisely what i mean said danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruined yes that is it ah said eugénie				880.3824428097072
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation				659.4910687210923
he had but one fault he was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent				2676.450413858161
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him				58.62953135968378
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession to whom tell m cavalcanti something of the state of your finances ma foi monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord do you hear what he says major certainly i do but do you understand i do your son says he requires money well what would you have me do said the major				1876.4930591465084
he dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away				404.19129773920815
then d artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly				17085.39542891613
don t be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind				5537.988753677634
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue				2466.688278436697
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion				30059.78778342141
his companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out				202.6148636085216
let us load the guns the four musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready				958.6647761366944
yes madame replied the officer				815.6708988990409
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle				8049.707521239709
tell them to take arms to come here and to run				67433.06547796866
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athos s chamber and that of the park				3824.9912058872724
then d artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful				20726.94680902659
but would you ruin me if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard house besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear				2053.233280373242
a man whose name is franz d épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda no he is a man about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a knitting needle but he paid your ransom he said two words to the chief and i was free and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp				568.0867801442957
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket				771.1195044978533
then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated				7750.539779268301
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him				52.43700833406862
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched				8635.18608263135
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from d artagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment				2171.5946722328977
the king called the cardinal				391.0242389734885
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope but one the last the last so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship and it is not yours no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde she comes from india also but she is not mine perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her shall i tell you plainly one thing sir				443.60052985587106
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant				1607.1502909775872
debray perhaps as it was once proposed				7315.250241378415
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall				2225.790967357261
yes returned aramis				50.19878531375459
she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order				1928.8957881370723
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing				199.50214827698642
well why should not we too belong to a party				4860.837310466347
the banker soon returned				967.9830499307898

madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth				38852.354400881115

patrick who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name				789.1110198914769
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion				7569.157774421859
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world				622.9955139783465
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon				20638.42318407234
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits for the abbé adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit				4612.698211889593

courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m				459.39459065466804
how can we be implicated in any way				670.5914701940576
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard				1366.7044681873044
oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos				668.168218932423
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillon s graces but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed				658.7549914238818
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen				264.3779487814835

what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have i				637.8719208718363
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word				654.4593475058447
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished				1391.0974985190326
thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than m de tréville possessed at the commencement of his				1111.9815127942543

whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle				8079.764428615582
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard				986.9373776633153
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes				648.4473186575034
what a flavor cried d artagnan ah				235.63097641994062
athos took her hand and kissed it				103.14675131879869
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos yes true as gospel said d artagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities i remember well said planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men drink				2969.4694298584977
and are the first of men added d artagnan				1.0850598829576628
a groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles				44415.65831825333
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital				4715.780243379497
by my father s tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him				45.755229155882894
there let us dine then said porthos it is getting cold the friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton bazin planchet and grimaud				1934.61325237154

both got into albert s coupé and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance				32786.678132527566
can we have the honor of seeing his highness i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on				607.8014178246808
then i must wait asked the young man				88.45967569696992
do you know m andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully not badly by any means said the young man i was born for a diplomatist well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive				24154.501239517725
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds				5936.2859671169745
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said you are monsieur d artagnan i am that individual replied the officer				808.2577154024235
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer yes much said d artagnan who did not well know how to answer				762.7468350265757
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him				45.6448118417262
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart				165.1046150743199
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted				6210.190186052619
monsieur de bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is since paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay				4110.721799361781
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english spain is her country replied d artagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself				1796.1051217639542
is he a shepherd or a nobleman young or old tall or short				6492.384556693217
in the meantime i remain here				668.6351418936505
i have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so i swear				38287.74138051269
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal				460.2301736291546
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger				2295.3930739161383
i love you as one loves a father brother husband				1927.9100475312864
and i really don t know what prevents me from exterminating you all alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see				1000.3763912615539
what do you want m bertuccio said he				7.79895792690876
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him				56.3424028471792
now said planchet let us bind him to a tree this being properly done they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day				511.5717212034813
my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head				337.037997053227
when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my steward thus i do not waste a minute or a word				664.9225086524252
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful				4293.201720768795
now he said are you in pain yes my head is not only swimming but burning what s the matter with this head said d artagnan raising the battered hat				3425.291185790398
toward four o clock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed				1927.4329903064345
in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me				62.70200357669948
captivity the third day felton had fallen but there was still another step to be taken				1254.1017067447062
i remembered him well				433.71440513354844

well come set to ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried planchet				193.96020098081343
in truth my dear captain i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de chemerault to whom i promised an abbey				89799.05261449252
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment				749.2673049605223
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this doubtless doubtless athos				374.2874303495788
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile				412.87217699900776
then m de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m de la trémouille to interrogate him himself				184.51486794815025
be one or the other but not both replied porthos				13.926351874032488

the burglary chapter				268.3489047719924
i would not go at all said aramis				10.19432047986943
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship				4225.134532201805
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery				3515.2317205081627
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone				1657.2331926839313
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem				5289.276442069461
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror				1146.5489482781338
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience				4122.074926382791

well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you morrel i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid				5130.543318785452

matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coupé did not appear				7253.817639590093
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison				1154.7620338907159
fine vengeance that on my faith a cold sweat broke from d artagnan s brow				1039.8330919255766
for you know athos				40.56884092617141
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy				661.0927185853205
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him				42.9842282443864
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect				11533.203119302438
oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks oh my lord				455.35726375303904
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself				1543.3859218972968
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man				320.5575969082689
the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the king s name were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more when at the shout in the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms ill treated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards				1766.6123027867106
no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected				10743.434821893772
besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience				8634.230857467408
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for				1060.7763703172634
but i but i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross leap coward cried raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir said he courage				1919.196456601373
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation				9843.134965749647
you are a hundred times too good begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight				6488.472631618326
bonacieux s glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness				8354.11865832984
they arrived at ablain without accident				3460.6802978951214
die in peace lord de winter advanced in his turn				826.0479892328775
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about francs debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness				1513.6986945836666
athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king				568.7462255236868
close to the hedge the steps stopped				2109.8048997021847
and i also said aramis				10.853671008543015
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door				242.32947597807518
i shall be at vendin to place it in position				4049.1412838801243
i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence				7307.176068430615
ask him then for the written order				3187.0641109286285
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him				47.630618467551976
yes said morrel it is true i have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you are you then come from m de morcerf s asked monte cristo				57.79762634444009
you morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs				1119.4349612174228
you are only betrayed the king sighed deeply				4286.941984926751
do you not see how she suffers haydée answered with a heartrending expression why should he understand this my sister				2733.6344375162594
from this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous				9969.663324267964
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious the monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed				667.8455475382846
he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke				8813.195410482587
the devil thought d artagnan				1.0225776426683078
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent				1401.8689641798621
oh yes scoundrel				8731.768832472202
she found m bonacieux alone the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied justice not being one of the three things which king solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage				2222.0740781295044
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge				3336.2707144675633
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop				827.3685764667268
so young cried felton covering that hand with his kisses				11664.769034631974
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he can not offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husband s money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him				54.981204277321574
i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel				80.5530533863329
you here at this hour said she				39.072610559125955
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open				2191.29790532494
you know i have made the most of my arms though i never forgot my origin a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo				55.32561742492868
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy				36068.82109883941
he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antechamber				2032.9520827414512
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room				198.41417443971707
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes				1389.6999077771807
the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for no thank you				74.64475989893485
dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him				43.03502801306777
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf				1720.111323922972
d artagnan hits on a plan				2659.071216090908
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart yes replied mme				65.3292599892149
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them the queen spoke with some impatience				6584.62004766716
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse				83.62097006902219
villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin				7838.139846209732
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh				2236.444640164175
i have dreamed that the unlucky englishman was dead				606.8587779627229
monsieur d artagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live				3133.7178658465623
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles				10423.117591737388
the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess				4578.5263218724585
no never				3788.3903673748587
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin				3454.596484050912
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry				30121.140885589673
on the morrow at three o clock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères				43733.146185697835
we must extricate ourselves from this position but how listen				3243.795452446237
and so the good la ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner				985.9947288613648
adieu then edmond i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were				2439.565744364372
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle oh heavens cried athos				15.39894780741958
what cried he in an accent of greater astonishment than before your second witness is monsieur aramis doubtless				8368.607443942294
the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows				11849.163012438872
in fact the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman and he awaited with impatience the moment always in the future when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock				7273.900030709052
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter d artagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner				1726.1183657931647
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other i don t say exactly answered the gascon confused				6818.361401862103
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo what do i think said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars such was albert s opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it				88.58356319328155
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort				267.73553290058265
is it not so eh who knows				2859.9679915201473
the duke exchanged a signal with them				111.40130669248268
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups				13103.200615579062
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death and i i swear to you before god madame said d artagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine				61666.093281538706
will that do my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks well then said athos it is agreed				136580.68141446603
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how ill formed are your objections to valentine s marriage noirtier answered only by a look which made villefort s blood run cold				2862.7732137872313
and they pursued their road in mournful silence				966.9957933167642
well cried he throwing his sword upon the bed this man must be the devil in person he has disappeared like a phantom like a shade like a specter do you believe in apparitions asked athos of porthos				89.09168295939294
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival				8581.39756893833
row porthos row and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further				2336.2845298014595
he seemed scarcely five and thirty				9263.884275510767
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor				8384.288675191854
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he was				1296.4562629358452
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters				6254.296942692763
answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones				10139.66040001371
evidently he did not understand his meaning				2680.012190019448
peste if he is giving away hats like that porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment to morrow				3574.0771712968267
i fell upon one knee then upon both				6166.312150819519
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done mordaunt bowed humbly				11268.79833659282
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes				658.8401231347804
ah the traitor and he disappeared				548.0000442722646
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver of whom of myself cried morcerf parbleu do you think i can not be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads				3850.824192977062
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace				2787.720689457213
to this question de guiche could not respond				49781.80784560606
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused				7190.75418053765
scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle a faintness seized him a cloud of blood passed over his eyes and he fell in the middle of the street crying still coward				1977.1802535865443
explain it athos groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself d artagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers				2880.7474010369583
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful				46745.882715011656

m de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses he wanted air				1023.7168555317711
no sooner said than done				1626.9332745395516
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance				6431.0141077102235

the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition				7914.749674010679
this time without knowing why d artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins				4955.021453532228
this is modesty indeed cried d artagnan				1.054264545458143

what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation				51056.041875287934
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all				251.81246301813937
and who brought you up he asked again				383.5107007143366

like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès				768.1337055643999

dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it				58.49340054133962
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps				1027.1190178253792

d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth				6588.275779428401
do not be angry we can try it caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut				50196.46832793712

duty before everything				682.0608166353477
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope				1851.329353118921
monsieur the coadjutor s carriage she exclaimed falling back				886.4200312362736

he lighted it and retired				1447.7946481321362
it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him				63.91409042526532
there he stopped breathless and panting				62067.05971806327
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean did i say dead or alive replied mazarin				350.3532852627014
she stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if valentine s glass were empty				2278.654482116737
this woman passed for his sister				2592.47117463335
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward				929.3913194985419
little flirtations perhaps and that s all				286.692869844988
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i can not leave				4902.4525675763325
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself				1497.8745075510092
you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you grimaud bowed				763.3672059621497
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left				854.9861597442105
look at his uniform monsieur commissary look at his uniform that s true murmured the commissary pardieu that s true at this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the bastille gave a letter to the commissary				5026.106240281268
why did you not say so at once my dear sir				248.06385183800424
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty				3932.6362326821054
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière				30336.488452754005
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king to the king				290.1229432077175
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy				698.5541234715988
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape				2058.6860281445215
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered				607.0645569150428
no from you yes you thoroughly understand me sir				273.2067993916028
the world calls me beautiful				3910.361847718894
my dear fellow don t speak like that of monsieur groslow				1190.2625676465273
and madame de villefort cried baptistin				4276.194950576901
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majesty s pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur d artagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said d artagnan bowing				2426.9733260145626
d artagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted				8301.020036944288
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself to them or to us do you mean aramis to no one				735.9817696821486
she loves him devilishly he murmured				3229.208353275213
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them				102.49125024670717
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain				7364.093665106363
the queen who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all la ramee s praises of his deputy				11293.187604612449
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				9077.724154366686
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp				7317.748206901943
nonsense cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method what i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted and then asked mazarin turning pale				752.0657210992941
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone				1562.831818016564
at the moment he opened the door the three musketeers and d artagnan conducted by la chesnaye appeared at the top of the staircase				1693.3893682353446
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes				14217.693768124935
where does he live rue férou two steps from here let us go both resumed their way				602.6486070977081
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos				13.664131039701724
she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of buckingham was written there at full length				5603.968880246048
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words				905.7631147824038
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled				622.658730598093
franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello				6813.973629383842
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt				2588.423354561746
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also				1918.9027177992793
we shall see better what is going on and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you				113.73107278057557
you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume				22220.317668845804
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared				542.0497051548539
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped				1774.5942014747425
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat				3711.9749428254745
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up				1095.6076781085858
it is he cried bonacieux				742.5797780265154
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment have you no friends who could assist you morrel smiled mournfully				35585.90305695643
the man who lives to see shall see and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court				1435.223507633826
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine i have already told you that we do not sell at retail well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive they are all the same price and what is that twenty five thousand francs a bottle tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal it is possible such may be the master s intention the master who is he the person to whom you were conducted yesterday where is he here let me see him certainly and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars				248.06195926822923
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding				34592.20306460598
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read				6343.391966130668
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life andrea visibly changed countenance				1607.4438294394388
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you				158.0688535015472
you have some in the house have you not yes send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic villefort immediately despatched a messenger				4426.087550060578
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key				19422.796417714457
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice				253.39373258699794
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face				618.6801773506181
truly she might have thought of you at home i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her touching sympathy				3726.698669976375
at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times				2124.6647914819428
the count again refused				9396.192612381283
a child he exclaimed				3338.7087991080743
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject				1379.4218046995547
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows				11428.727511376956
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous				26076.227986711518
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand				238.27077697942923
he thought that voice more feeble than usual				4390.7221566656035
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall see him				43.91581407155178
d artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel				7162.009708158575
in fact about four o clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance				7144.920416148873
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door				196.00965337130768
his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships				6925.107533601828
what then have i to fear from him you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life				567.9380838059409
have you not mentioned that name to me as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright				13808.545349328739
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him				46.89666873520053
oh cried mme				75.11700572255039
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan				67610.40574990567
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started				820.0207174339873
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i don t know how long to the amount of or francs during the year				3099.0142009589745
in all probability this time his master would not retract				15920.753671277706
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old why not				411.4329917094153
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased				3870.4148687529837
upon my word				647.5778027272373
madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them				108.0039722885068
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it they ll kill poor porthos when he comes up said aramis				17.46505165060506
locusta chapter				187.50216605630715
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion something he had till then doubted he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat				4205.171828907152
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second				2871.3888654495663
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home				2029.5504443431057
well sir what you tell me is impossible				2211.813677895787
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated april in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable				39154.3885823384
mine host s face does not please me at all it is too gracious nor me either said athos				14.339093471386752
silence said d artagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him				47.63090236900749
it is i said d artagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de wardes oh my god my god murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named well said milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter				2286.6186329022503
at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only three quarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavern keeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace				2648.5617646306605
you were among them you were				3046.142274031379
you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it				83.8952707667762
i will warn them what the devil are you going to do cried d artagnan you will be shot but athos heeded not his advice				6581.342921103246
are they both dead asked lord de winter sternly				44654.52010921263
what do you wish to see first asked the abbé				558.1325087285653
well tempter what more do you want with me said d artagnan				1.4809826615394985
give way at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late				3458.463165208475
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself				225.4682863500748
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction				6869.813741249459
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha it is true nevertheless then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated how so yes				775.7331589772931
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher and what did he do the rest of his time monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory which as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot				8644.480335904569
it appears that after having challenged m de monte cristo at the opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today impossible said madame de villefort				110.35100170356127
now am i at liberty to retire said the general				3434.03397898643
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks where do you come from from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost				951.8196269174183
yes yes i see him well enough said d artagnan				1.1983114589512098
then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let				17173.34740673871
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions				42203.484355017266
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her				140.58351639633833
and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan				1.7194668998284326
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room				215.93091426693707
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father haydée became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord haydée haydée you are young and beautiful forget even my name and be happy it is well said haydée your order shall be executed my lord i will forget even your name and be happy and she stepped back to retire				3650.8729989191543

if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abbé smiled				669.0503875466571
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan				366.74854046804126
such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions				2116.601518812028
i can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon the substitute for monsieur d artagnan still holds his place the two friends looked at each other				598.7807794532656
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage				2945.1795225322453
chapter xxxi				5664.000691420004
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks				3980.5414280338705
now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example not at all plainly enough messrs thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so by what right sir by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more danglars bit his lips				528.400262143497
let me overtake him he				38.99644572296924

gondy smiled the queen s color rose and mazarin grew even paler				12103.27995783331
at this moment comminges rushed into the room				189.58071542258153
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				2273.8526641878548

he held a vial of salts in his hand				198.32421953749568

next moment the door opened and the man disappeared the scoundrel said aramis				26.36253326414534
he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin				24790.352363547026
then he paused				2645.9513071756774
they stopped him at the door				244.76451687161432
don t let us disarrange your eminence				2073.8512924898655

a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well				429.71072893948
a rondeau said the curate mechanically				16827.05704407561
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence				1903.4513674653415

the count de villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as henry iv				1477.141322774815
yes yours your own property sir my right hand correspondent is signalling let him signal sir you have distracted me i shall be fined that will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bank notes sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient never mind take these and the count placed the packet in the man s hands				633.2599518879953
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me				57.26034790590835
do you aramis order the servants				2766.5263999640956
ho said he good advice advice of a friend				751.0637075923851
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie				25798.964585420646
the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door				222.99127063955686
the four friends were reunited				30186.534142380577
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten				1710.4453075868996
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne so near as that said the count but that is not in the country				2579.729075571442
andrea read in a low voice you are poor a miserable old age awaits you				142.01715724572725
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god but let me see how was it done				658.5715715506906
come he said stretching out his hand to d artagnan come don t be sullen my dear son for i have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a father				675.746898807693
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				3275.9719684778665
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars				102.6249034985574
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge				11094.50444524822
then he pointed to the door				258.508059717469
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy				48490.378419080545
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse				8235.729787560553
danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love				976.72193793005
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it				67.32074021392427
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish				49933.58095277785
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis				332.51119435554966
villefort looked at valentine as they said this				970.1132293955819
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance				9070.368522571427
i am finishing the most execrable morning s work what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently my papers thank god no my papers are all in capital order because i have none but m cavalcanti s m				399.74338033038873
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow				1053.940113118037
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine				7300.120218407478
he entered and on his way met the waiter				6282.4532203431145
in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress				6710.7386756217165
you came you say to see me yes well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day am i then to remain here eternally demanded milady with a certain terror				1616.5532042416594
well all that was useless				1626.8215657323656
ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she				46.376758042863486
what dreadful sufferings said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother				2130.9269731008335
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled				610.364197616559
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him				44.14663002151259
her skin was admired for its velvety softness her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable				40283.52183282135
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				2206.558158339957
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late still i will go				891.1178216739022
master broussel is being strangled it was friquet s voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk				32259.780194230192
d artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face				619.656839510159
go on sir said he				5.5549225821574595
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydée s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request oh it is nothing said monte cristo				101.9734967799772
de saint méran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault				64520.206586384134
adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer				885.0655387827142
we are first said morrel looking out of the window				607.4780621814843
his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy				18173.923528593685
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin				4681.313442453811
for tell me where can you find a love like mine a love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word				675.8055456164915
whom does this belong to he inquired				3385.4079346988533
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty				8830.206551168536
an h and an n surmounted by a baron s coronet by heaven m bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms where did you study heraldry in your service excellency where everything is learned go on i am curious to know two things what are they your excellency what became of this little boy				4102.450479977336
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d artagnan s deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville				5432.8635647378915
porthos and i will stay here the friends obeyed				1093.9617051497883
i don t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek he spoke the romaic language did he i think so that settles it murmured franz				837.5174062950628
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips				483.28929321548816
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart				168.17077363502034
dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury				7235.91579926666
the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed				4509.675523992332
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you that is not the custom excellency said peppino				2586.8550899100696
for mercy s sake then what would you call robespierre				47913.977749268146
she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been discovered				9115.8002031333
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return				1692.5715976608317
oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross knee breeches and how shall i be dressed demanded andrea				491.8489295593935
the air the fresh free air is so good besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour stop cried d artagnan i too am going and if i may without impertinence ask where are you going to seek my friends what friends those that you asked about yesterday athos porthos and aramis you are looking for them yes on honor what then is there surprising in that nothing				438.03852445155275
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife he did not forget his friends				535.5522687129629
she is perhaps a prisoner she is perhaps dead yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted while i well nothing replied aramis nothing so you renounce the world then forever that is a settled thing a resolution registered forever				3123.18007810244
i hear my brother				2597.7872753508705
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources however my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m de villefort				447.81646342928735
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to be				1183.0656004163482
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				3467.310467392146
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome				1633.4621347366112
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade				8133.503027148164
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him				45.15988868121278
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears				4773.721470042593
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him				53.84518967800519
the count came towards him				43.97063958638492
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this				1482.4553626454372
can he be afraid of this boy but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and retired				1416.7457861525988
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				2717.526522521396
porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity				6009.056950403403
athos said the musketeer				711.8792376954952
who prepared it the chemist who came here with me drink it said the doctor to barrois				2442.1996578893127
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets yes said athos that s grimaud s business well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls heaven forfend said athos they may serve us these bodies serve us said porthos				183.78245467567066
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe upon my honor said the prince				943.0247077601697
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st peter s successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues				15471.09178825995
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees				1541.0297584152331
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction				3798.552582608413
do you know monsieur d artagnan lieutenant in the king s musketeers said the voice you are monsieur d artagnan i am then you came here to defend him him				43.60715959676552
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets				45320.67080434827
the same deadly silence succeeded these words				972.3222760852501
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment				761.218257461851
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him beauchamp did the same				1190.2512164722484
you see he said to porthos				14.441313032218185
is this carriage for us asked milady				41.926348373954674
but as you are the strongest after all continued d artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look				1494.8698511741068
madame said albert allow me to present to you m maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner				846.1820936607061
rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at franz				390.8749171273793
every one stood up				1090.4613640009907
listen said he i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale				819.3125018138326
my first business will be to dispose of this diamond so saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse				2419.028961019732
deuce take those italian princes a man too who could boast of dante for a genealogist and could reckon back to the divina comedia a nobility of the rope said château renaud phlegmatically				13788.082955973208
it was just five o clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear				3542.2108050545535
they entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys				5945.736502557504
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical				23298.28839963286
alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter mademoiselle danglars eugénie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count				170.7576735358973
i will allow myself to die with hunger come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that				630.6070519646403
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high				4664.975351643801
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room				192.06080664467
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse				804.6475980156016
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern				7487.126807937931
monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart				170.06640593385632
those who love me follow me and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free				2144.5659227088745
my place of abode is no				381.38469184057885
where have you read in the scriptures i ask you that the english are your neighbors where that is true said blaisois at least i can t now recall it a child s reason i repeat it continued mousqueton				426.6923130719241
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention				733.0330993967054
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt				1047.4495448503947
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces don t be afraid				4021.368077106214
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the swiss				5361.494210546284
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird				5755.061495714181
pardieu if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people				818.7782277033917
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived				1751.7013262288503
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar				2166.718821269907
and he threw away his pistol				4267.293585441486
as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted				2708.50708295417
this was before his servant came				2270.3878513482186
here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs				38013.521798613445
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires now what are we to do with you said the captain				1136.5848401303197
your excellency is safe and sound asked the host				768.1337055643999
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing				25632.297774670646
he shall see how a gentleman can die the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically				78512.28582620903
here yes here in this convent my dear fellow				1400.9294198882722
it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the sailor unknown you say is the man who rendered you this service unknown to you yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian				1339.1648401299726
what then would be the use of all i have suffered				8139.501176867418
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets				16600.939752698243
yes i understand my lord observes that there will be enough to go around we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke				209.99366627973552
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch				1602.0911710451026
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach				10003.56865757522
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door				207.68774555733756
how do you think these garments fit me wonderfully said d artagnan but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better what asked porthos				24.18514984301474
you raised the whole district so they told me very nearly replied planchet with a self satisfied air				1130.433432973306
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also				1544.5741923179291
at length m de tréville himself returned				966.0970671380476
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service				1027.768166153254
that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand				1392.4447042128345
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a troop				4842.228414925793
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents				21787.379325794
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome				1622.268214990922
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind				725.5415590710124
eleven o clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st germain				2465.8885862258835
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill				32935.914070682025
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere				10046.888588807671
d artagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read dec				15720.931764727204
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting				11649.82743127642
if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus then aloud are you ambitious as enceladus well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape d artagnan s observation				4693.042824973095
it was a coupé of koller s building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas				40317.99694856781
a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain				4984.962386766678
he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal the guards of the cardinal				404.69368027914817

we shall require it yes gentlemen said d artagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do this new attack made no impression on mordaunt				2128.853096191995
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles				2622.1662728182487
d artagnan entered behind him				42.825459275783395

good heavens he exclaimed				2876.6925030932775
perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something else oh no i have seen him eat of everything in italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows in a word said mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended and she left the room				301.2414095046702
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared				935.3126615958942

mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers				2485.9837812539186

my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety				2580.8733322015237

my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one party i am for fresh air				815.3154831901097
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause				3792.82236169239
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear				6915.24773932856
he knew this was the last struggle				5225.551055811481
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything				1484.033272954718
a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd				27771.689647339128

i tremble to give my permission listen valentine				182.1800770357342
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel				4854.342464115289
not before me behind me but with what asked the duke				209.99576907870824
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs				1911.3550913473136

had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss				4213.766790704103

gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit				4705.079789169516
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant and what do you think of her personal appearance oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company				3734.625526997963
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for				1238.43111526978
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d artagnan who pressed it respectfully				7339.904313422139
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter				2095.6544176779234
the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief				2510.8731243038205

yes sire in solitary confinement in a dungeon like the lowest criminal the devil murmured the king what must be done sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal				242.37050030324784
i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where i have been concealed between two mattresses				46525.90752047126
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk				33062.48822868431
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor				39717.15837634063

they were innumerable				47417.584900457725
yes yes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness				2016.6218116007667
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place				696.892950616769
if you have it use it replied gondy				802.2493056772315
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him				45.011462994919626
some gendarme he exclaimed				2929.6950493045197

i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder				2307.0266488737543
this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation				28942.28319881065
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o clock				1187.0556331417558

i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor				1953.213818895957

madame said athos when must we set out you consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully				4820.926814344041
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal				42196.1195443243
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night				917.9733412991903
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it				120.08025658379263
oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail				16737.28674825131
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which d artagnan occupied with authority				5549.514264405208
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven				882.8779000792154

oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns which however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his protégé monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville				949.6906709267378
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word				689.6145459900061
i am lost murmured she i am lost				722.2406259377693
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars				132.6275245440668

her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas				1311.3119672546572
the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of to francs				1003.2856446737602
the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deep set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads				56612.49419648836
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word				662.8113955939821
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title				6427.041091207971
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either				3996.2199138610968
two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht				3858.6765030586976
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail				4678.831867122033
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable				32748.897131571644
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days				2141.5288820871283
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal my friend the cardinal cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed				51764.88962510541

and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty				2253.077283386333
besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king				292.7023737211337
i suffered frightful torments				121842.38363483733

tell me valentine for it is that i came to know valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement				3383.7230371357177
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it				93.87409948774825

they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade				39684.332387299255
the gascon is the devil cried athos nothing escapes him the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis				193.68764722315072

do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier				2836.4128400527206
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors				35721.196353813364
oh d artagnan the devil				1265.4043466779171
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy				48284.66015348815
oh my god said mme				96.19786880906275
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision				57210.32728127938
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarin impossible				1589.2378277323667
only leave him in the ante room as i wish to speak to you alone d artagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour both commands alike both at the palais royal				2116.2594024920863
what shall i do now nothing it is finished then no not yet i should like to understand said porthos				16.76209636516919

the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her				131.18654168966484
open the door cried villefort				94.53162737149444
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy				3354.164774209294
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed				4293.79134278914
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me be it so				283.70539101278723
athos came down last and found d artagnan already on horseback and growing impatient				51049.90719856072
la carconte double locked the door behind the jeweller chapter				372.6927794520798
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault				6862.021801255721
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so				436.68753251310267
now victory has abandoned him				40.8652935214211
the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment				768.9347994879242
these keys were given up to him instantly				2099.4831774090167
all at once he uttered a terrible cry				4048.8439545196024
to cours la reine cried d artagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance				16706.71570006947
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos how many have we killed of them a dozen or fifteen how many did we crush under the wall eight or ten and in exchange for all that not even a scratch				46720.07781876473
i thought i did not mistake				3863.2791467484158
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre				26473.63597318034
it must be done				637.9823408833236
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative				36350.81101995882
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time ah				492.41799823776154
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets				49152.68197776216
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat				30310.750671429563
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared				563.1900908897514
and what is a fronde inquired mazarin				64.4627250516571
is life worth the trouble of so many questions				10325.093345307283
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of francs				1009.2306128740089
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother				1968.695461300968
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him his first words were well what s the matter				862.1402933367185
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured d artagnan				1.2144381939721167
with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell				1971.7769610946816
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me				91.77807336839975
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest				6455.045422749954
always the same always the child s corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture				1696.5535696732002
d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver				3071.5270113262663
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion				3369.6055342888662
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen				5126.483845699086
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door				229.74516370280128
cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle				93881.4498565451
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine				1107.585570189603
oh said he that is life to me more more two drops more would kill you replied the abbé				362.15047527427373
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy asked milady				60.917264303168785
come haydée come and throwing his arm around the young girl s waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared				580.3134020513418
never sire i entreat you to do so besides in what manner can i make advances first by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her what is that give a ball you know how much the queen loves dancing				5679.362062712392
they made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling prison				1221.371775012049
do not fear pardieu we are alone i think i have discovered my father your true father yes not old cavalcanti no for he has gone again the true one as you say and that father is well caderousse it is monte cristo bah yes you understand that explains all				313.102176312511
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect				7201.672963340656
suddenly edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of fernand as it was defined in the shadow				4138.0425216848835
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed				8090.960512095482
ah there you are my good d arminges i have given you a great fright have i not				505.7723245345258
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn				766.4579979360219
duc d harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were				2465.778060936168
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore				5173.451159346133
i did not even touch your hand and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord				514.3881293718373
the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed				5285.444203233838
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them				116.70626750626373
no replied athos fortunately monsieur d artagnan has only fainted ah indeed so much the better said lord de winter				379.7398844017713
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so				336.1023458291793
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person				847.2342449617524
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore				4447.158355395541
one throw is soon made and if i lose you will win but if i lose well you will surrender the harnesses have with you for one throw said d artagnan				27.81833997959808
but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him				43.19630409033153
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse				805.3727071519045
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it				83.47285141440084
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors				7761.479507395496
his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him				59.532227871942936
a real father yes so long as he pays me you ll honor and believe him that s right				1053.2478159307673
thank you madame i am aware of them now monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head the cardinal cried mme				72.70667673798879
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak				1179.813358419735
they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summer house overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library				11840.148849443822
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head				335.75939122834353
spare me then i beseech you				67.360460902017
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land				4382.468343994467
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan				1.4345971389603132
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips				480.58036567387734
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m noirtier				1193.6466298957525
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head				353.4274268656636
yes no doubt				1410.8981060237566
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator well when we quitted naples captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever				4830.4117741500295
one last favor my lord said he to the baron				3445.568029927788
i am luigi vampa shepherd of the san felice farm what do you want i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before				679.7056596962526
the château d if the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dantès right and the other on his left				867.8648793841094
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz				139.7544629565926
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing ah said a gallant old general who in had sung partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden then said mercédès i will lead the way turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercédès				1321.6364168227171
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper				1591.3307537620208
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet				132.01864378144398
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me oh cried andrea leaping with joy				685.4575128830471
so much the better				1216.1031741965833
well my faith				1622.7432489952896
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions				3411.416660411346
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him				50.585841374871194
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return				1586.9191138700774
there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself				208.90016943515184
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four				5888.196721877857
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter the answer to madame s replied kitty all in a tremble				1651.8683286611486
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps silence laporte you may be overheard				11951.462472352054
here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them and d artagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in anne s hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty				4864.018410733185
this way constance				9187.348880522606
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale				5328.768270445189
i understand wait a little porthos before crying out for on my word you haven t reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone				1026.475663570877
the enemy cried the king				426.0277114608421
good heavens				1478.7361404251667
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme				384.0967045982524
you are in prison then rochefort trembled in every limb at this question				1222.2940550435646
let us talk of those if you please				2459.549632057778
anne de bueil murmured the wounded man				144.37540374099643
at this instant the door opened				1726.1274196680483
the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities but once again that gentleman where is he				598.0930692496332
on the morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things				2381.4981388975557
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model				12502.660577303934
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply				3495.631527421228
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would fail				16480.1722221853
i will therefore proceed				7770.441004575497
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict				33219.15665414979
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and château renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back				1239.8214121069127
morrel was mad				1348.7660539150104
then cried villefort was it you who bought m de saint méran s house did it belong to m de saint méran demanded monte cristo				89.14671442999801
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence				6127.428887996095
well then said aramis				10.913492485933428
gaspard caderousse he had married a woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village				5219.419999077472
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock				8015.85512700657
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened				5201.675126637531
and you did cry he asked				749.3248290058586
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage				6244.784742090366
ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband mercédès and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope fernand replied mercédès you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry				37765.10100437975
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door				206.15760267435212
i know it well so take grimaud take mousqueton take bazin take planchet				1052.777835696335
peppino remained breathless				28121.411413252146
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking besides who says that it will begin again it has returned count exclaimed morrel that is why i hastened to you well what do you wish me to do				1223.1009652210846
you know he has estates porthos i should think so indeed				845.9315628043383
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side				907.5685324289503
when i return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he doesn t speak a word of french i take him into my service				1021.2775706678137
is the king wounded cried lord winter				359.13743379096405
it was a mixed mass of blue red and gold				2350.6661449322573
a small white cloud which had attracted dantès attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the château d if				1329.2782378027928
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege				7439.992857748822
and now remember one thing monsieur officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness i promised him to wait replied morrel and i will wait at this moment barrois entered				382.62516046714813
the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely				48066.931816610966
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first				1785.1674408312897
i believe not				256.6906310788127
what a scandal				30545.858950724672
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de voiture what does you mean by boor michon said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came				2600.797873036156
duke said flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen				430.675053859966
he approached her				182.82065235182665
well then asked athos in a low tone				1023.258100890519
bonacieux in her power				2859.523447155873
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray				363.05804361658124
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward				5858.91794703118
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given				1434.3724064231337
you told me that what matters it to you kitty				1390.964839449215

at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams				3051.1168338242765
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees				1714.6925278053955
besides maximilian morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father				733.8924161222836
speak tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest now resumed grimaud i ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me i ll try said the duke				791.636865254575

luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house				389.6729168730882
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves listen to monsieur de tréville said the king listen to him				43.9607967592575
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps				988.1051768892373
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really				4187.048056870443
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey				1738.3181289762242
pardon you monseigneur				3295.3900229316046

i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness				2350.821953105768

terror recalled me to myself				835.8967783451346
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner				994.6116237474752

d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend				695.6406247886039
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame and by whom				7009.151180018829

ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws i had lost all in thirteen throws				32351.251878716383
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day				511.99097565305306
the palikares who were prostrated at my father s feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke				35762.5768980153
our recruits from béarn are not generally very rich and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province				17665.053794392392

in the first place light me a torch ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment				641.2124174087365
god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death				957.1045014390945
he converted his chamber into an observatory				34823.10641012105
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch				1551.1401048249445
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m de saint méran advertised it for sale two or three years ago m				412.7580065661027

the count felt his heart beat more rapidly				18322.857759641716

when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men				496.9755931013945
now this point was settled mme				79.09240977538586
what said monte cristo				43.45660473634626
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count				248.52061948051235
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight				2722.891312692304
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute				44128.849950967226
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus				43153.290972341914
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak				1094.9182921734434
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him come now aramis said d artagnan you must be taking me for some one else nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman				7739.445707773531
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors				6037.179980523998
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth				2635.2838487862587
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter				1829.4824071841856
you are here said she				39.79573275499578
besides d artagnan passed the evening with me well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with a brow flushed with anger				1896.228521609184
women weep for the dead men avenge them oh yes cried d artagnan yes				499.6149109567567
hear the end				1225.712492292786
it is important that he should receive it before eleven o clock				1211.3395101688138
athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers				3131.7968196770203
all this showed d artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this veil				26213.5125755329
has he not already forgotten she ever existed				9528.827438281527
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier				6831.339715224948
and does he not live in the champs élysées yes no				325.54711644243577
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck				2202.055267431628
i shall always love you be sure of that				837.027934733242
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said athos				12.71664503432828
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt				46369.27745131925
the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon which he reached as she rounded into la réserve basin				7652.393999453245
what shall we do yes why the same we had intended doing three days since set off what although you are not now going to be married you intend still listen louise				3288.8941277900126
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners				12160.179732390645
no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies allies said the queen shaking her head				343.042513440508
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said beauchamp in a calm tone				1334.0463430501356
athos had been out since six o clock				1162.697926784266
you understand this do you not my most precious wife				1367.2500461659483
then he had a moment s hesitation				5959.099373671781
the sentinel wanted to repulse him but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer				1217.683802303627
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door				220.54861881249747
oh my god my god i thank thee madame said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice				426.6833608048378
bonacieux eagerly and looking at d artagnan with disquiet				32630.27555378735
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the count s iron grasp				6067.262790846921
and d artagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected				42336.47285025625
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her				117.76667871949707
well do you not adopt this means athos said d artagnan				1.2247874788940265
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt				1272.6227178832767
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres				27928.152749921595
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice				584.1170856582355
have you finished grimaud grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes				33421.38285981377
but said the count so great was ali pasha s confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave				1641.0967394788427
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you				73.21321730424225
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive				10247.420201801537
i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look out well then look replied d artagnan				1.801666547380541
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality				2649.91471095549
d artagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch				3082.437243454136
all is well i thank you now leave us alone mr felton chapter l chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sister in law s fauteuil milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen				6293.523112422644
is it not so asked monte cristo				43.46637612757224
but enough of money matters				3982.0677689276026
château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane				3294.5007506816137
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks m coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme				285.89875398207107
bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully				65259.21314339255
then you hope said d avrigny with surprise				1212.2218444070886
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness				9747.645761960608
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend				4119.716930882497
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan				31624.175982461165
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed				61473.49992807999
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected				3984.073404404023
but you know him m de morcerf is it that excellent m bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smuggler in fact everything				1070.9048577853546

but what are you looking for i am looking for the person who let down the ladder				2908.4904521082235
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad				1380.1837006169612
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water				1443.0396642456878
one only is still not in our power and braves us				503.75510353338325
the queen is likely to follow mazarin s counsels and to have me tried do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does did she not love an englishman my friend she is a woman no no you are deceived she is a queen dear friend i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria adieu athos i am going to raise an army for what purpose to come back and besiege rueil where shall we meet again at the foot of the cardinal s gallows the two friends departed aramis to return to paris athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen				252.00994131019894
remained alone and turning his eyes on his half opened horace muttered justum et tenacem propositi virum m de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king s authority				5474.461102612778
the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back				1318.9425173487325
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt m de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home				1875.3471938933676
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed				1891.9655334252036
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart go monsieur de bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed				6206.702813756959
ali had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the gates of st sebastian				31348.64283180454
take these said beauchamp presenting the papers to albert				314.0312945969752
name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends well said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron monsieur de ferussac the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said don t you know a gentleman named athos milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks				4597.69125342755
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof ah no madame that could not be				1229.2383725917769
my idea said d artagnan				1.1306240571006307
beauchamp chapter				206.52430596259228
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion				5871.156160014225
about forty leagues only				4310.629654315627
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions				5211.074220819191
he went toward the place where he had left him				42.75344478408625
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle				5369.804349906029
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund				4058.2300012963083
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme				307.6818738006756
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still yes we				10914.877873775122
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered				11593.004767361941
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour				1161.886542696438
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again but how did the accident happen asked raoul				437.2455255463814
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo re entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan				2819.4814976490566
judge for yourself replied he				7.6964290688943136
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering				7695.191300840372
the young woman hastened to meet him				47.29240475735649
pray continue well then listen				3710.0921324238757
when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination				5844.798613509708
d artagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond				2183.094177654144
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity				6028.802872802795
caderousse became thoughtful				4369.327006196731
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor				7273.622558735868
the devil murmured he between his teeth				3016.0879473874597
i have something to say to you certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck				45370.44567263814
the night was quiet enough				1660.9799527609387
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage				1049.817173351344
d artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis				4398.337110990959
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench				20326.090136651623
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti				1386.8719032560355
he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it				100.35473336357454
do you agree with aramis not at all said d artagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion what				715.3258481969193
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances				6796.022985459277

what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom				6665.593013216437
madame de villefort was dead				629.5320758290179
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains				3979.023261569431
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger				1924.609833587102
never cried d artagnan				1.1477789961494989
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck				2849.2350991647195
princes must be knocked on the head i remember it said athos				11.894715738538963
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed				32485.522407598142
madame say that you would love me then				254.04849576480333
take a post chaise or a carriage no it would delay me and i need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me good albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door				329.0934970837371
franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february				2016.9632085712158
it is the password				37403.08964046781
what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it				62.281074553328345
there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrel s petition m de villefort s marginal notes				6828.115614033228
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men				408.0040899705353
the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words				803.8303786930555
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death				942.9608568924027
good evening m de morcerf the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality				31934.366429697846
speak if you please said mazarin				62.660039927306
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard				35589.53453994681
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a woman s weakness there are twelve days well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations yes sire				2625.3165356805575
his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious				12059.048983067638
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied and now we understand each other when do you wish the carriage to be here in an hour in an hour it will be at the door an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival				5008.851400579378
d artagnan looked at porthos				69.15854053933852
for you				115.59949723558324
it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers				5347.104784407721
the yard was empty the clock was striking twelve				10707.287332185717
in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate				6489.165712278733
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked gondy				757.881122344878
anne of austria deprived of the confidence of her husband pursued by the hatred of the cardinal who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling having before her eyes the example of the queen mother whom that hatred had tormented all her life though marie de médicis if the memoirs of the time are to be believed had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which anne of austria always refused him anne of austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her her most intimate confidants her dearest favorites				46231.24786274173
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest				1424.0579049016449
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others				1450.481266347677
you will kill yourself cried planchet				131.18641658048904
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii				3938.8518916446355
with monsieur monsieur has returned then of course naively replied the servant				4740.725152720242
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end				1225.6733337457824
the nails too were turning blue				8051.48873572315
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances				89226.41945718342
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate				4134.646113358461
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement				60406.03979988155
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense				7341.479455011888
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching				44277.74320801504
as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle				9714.431808940739
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d artagnan who having seen all was coming to him				52.75031450789427
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him				42.76062141010804
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				9315.214376379985
they passed into the next drawing room where tea was prepared				43178.608219962145
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old				3757.0524248512706
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him				47.64163508503298
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everything you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni				3011.644362724392
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble				1720.7503885313506
poor fellow poor fellow murmured caderousse				80.04147952415697
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy				4291.740298672859
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket				835.3389432613264
are people to be run against without warning				7360.688323415768
go on as i entered nîmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned				49149.775773357906
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings				52390.963879988485
adieu dear sister till your next swoon this was all that milady could endure				7433.028505183563
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze				6931.172933084543
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with basdry there said the dragoon				90837.21530622145
madame danglars had started when villefort on the count s invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own				820.1478075947309
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm				10505.628528666006
they had only halberds before now they have muskets				3580.060693181916
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society				5088.937633410116
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen				3365.180231092411
bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messenger s words				1075.4387628608497
restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered julie to monte cristo				124.66488713345458
the minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing after him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be destroyed				6353.478493829421
come come give it to me				50.45248245860537
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one				771.4637470466713
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen				1142.7353918718502
anne frowned				20737.425838221985
now look here i want something to eat				11489.181679497196
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos				14.477258661308825
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it				69.05273125440617
oh as to that i do not engage myself				606.3297458111821
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods				50815.10562010001
before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here ah try it milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony				8021.5140647990565
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible				974.5173006846491
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle				5613.511335861233
that is to say you are in love with this lady as you were with madame bonacieux said athos shrugging his shoulders contemptuously as if he pitied human weakness				2387.133900638835
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends				531.3901423681712
sir no and i do not know what has become of him so that i am really so unhappy that i weep in fact tears rolled down his cheeks				2431.2323443579276
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one				759.1220521226586
compiègne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of police they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there				451.46132050525364
athos cried d artagnan wringing his hands				584.0900689961192
to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains walls hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream				963.8805615747483
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear				4071.052937190947
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question				1305.9517777841443
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile				423.8221976275873
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was a beam				32519.836050638638
albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well				540.4833217084207
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation				2408.9478225951934
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime who said it was a crime asked villefort with a last effort				6258.503373075639
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation				10872.459591042
you have been here a very long time john said he				7.3664468997208585
franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel				2194.9790145466745
you are ill shall i ring for assistance shall i call no said villefort rising hastily stay where you are				2077.8344034218826
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him				48.512691643551875
you think then as i do that she deceives me said the king				309.63184266959604
at the same time added château renaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti there are no italian banditti said debray				264.0824910363484
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists				17979.68923566811
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady				776.1975203932718
i will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is take care returned albert no one has been able to accomplish that oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose and when you know will you tell me i promise you				140.047185941726
mousqueton cried d artagnan let us be off				1482.4617246673092
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party and what is the origin of this name it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned				4273.422743398711
ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient				14251.699790075698
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe				13180.177413777967
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement				5205.694849223807
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass it is singular said the doctor i was not aware that madame de saint méran was subject to such hallucinations it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed we will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone				747.8909048639521
m and mme				157.27566406079464
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me i shall not be more than half an hour and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him				60.613517951545674
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers				7828.002787671698
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed				1289.9549516327118
it was aramis				538.8993650690793
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters				3499.126985218775
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant				1610.695494033017
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse				820.0989244328421
volume three chapter				276.1649639303899
you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter				759.9981811387777
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said				188.9495170182909
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling				642.0856331009932
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet				58527.22082008412
nothing nothing replied the priest go on it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accomplice sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception				57157.70108175693
no it had just struck four				4443.550608835788
d artagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened				3400.0682668208196
oh god exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to heaven have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully i once spoke to you of four men what can be done with four four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time and where are these four men ah that is what i do not know				794.8625848654083
in a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling				89784.23828093233
you have your servant s clothes on you therefore keep a servant i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals				44004.74910086606
he had gained much information but not enough				1657.5161193031772
richest my dear fellow and d artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket				773.1009989694634
june and july were the terrible months with athos				497.20764718583035
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris eh cried the young man turning pale				772.0444526474573
what you don t know me no monseigneur well two words will refresh your memory				2693.0467166366925
a sacerdotal officer				1454.519850723272
meantime he was going to try to find out milady				274.96279549579066
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed				787.0862391030529
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant				2547.9849479673294
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him				51.75624618318797
but why should i meddle in the matter				833.8290808964568
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist				9906.315226088263
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace				30126.25450460904
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written				18054.484258610166
they sat silent and dejected				5574.683746392243
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand				198.1437706856542
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance				2718.475226582891
indeed my dear friend said beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair albert remained silent and wrapped in thought				2189.667435387352
you accuse him then				250.4933203227779
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme				208.5562955146685
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall				974.5493645502842
my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity				12527.71299915662
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert s mask fell off				1611.4667902651563
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				973.0653101527865
m de tréville entered the king s cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip				11430.820365485812
you arrive in good time dear d artagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence				5049.364099167619
alone valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit				54220.587785531214
colonel pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow yes said harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table				610.2585576679377
peste you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going out no one can reproach you for anything of the kind monsieur bonacieux said the young man you are a model for regular people				1009.1651665387161
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately				1906.0089881694282
what else can a strapping chap of twenty one mean with a fine wench of seventeen and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans he went before i came down let us go the same way we will stop at la réserve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news come along said caderousse but you pay the score of course replied danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses				6904.394474497634
young people stop there said the tutor joining in the conversation				657.4796485057998
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty				2086.411480648464
your treasure stammered dantès				212.4412471867247
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write				5184.094404487054

d artagnan threw down a yet smoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his mistress				1630.3448578685889
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man i cover mine said d artagnan				26.389687241065392
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses				11358.577908933545
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations				13132.211338466042

pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance				1268.3753098317477
the chevalier murmured charles				3549.5116699486525
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men				431.9808720100369
yes doctor is this the same lemonade of which you partook i believe so what did it taste like it had a bitter taste the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace				54824.94227142263

let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts				29184.91824196517
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow				1082.1311472247633
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son				960.6333548720875
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name				769.8938376350508
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it				107.74148570457844

everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow				38072.913520968796
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror				1086.5483289895958

at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless				3022.5205981385475
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini				9439.762680817132
well while i was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was				1254.4109120424969

try me gentlemen said he and i swear to you by my honor that i will not go hence if we are conquered what is your name my brave fellow said athos				26.084445729576952
do you take any interest in politics a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan				313.4917896673539
he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged				4881.961404637318
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted				2615.18364985751
thank you la ramee said the prisoner				1860.5836642036093

in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance				3650.8172914431852
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing				414.84343029146424

the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death				1082.8956136295753
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination				2870.0213754626193

but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father no but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted at the words i will beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to albert s countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments				5433.506069350365

good evening madame said the banker good evening m debray probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day				511.4224539041337
go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service				1048.2874790587434
suddenly the jailer entered				373.3377269671791
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera				5337.0836736183255
what is it i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him i am glad to be reassured on that point				2369.389603132275
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate				6107.622044415296
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris do you hesitate asked mazarin				75.2791879869903

at the word notary noirtier made a sign to her to stop				3323.222626811919
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter xix				5437.9746132712
i don t know english athos said d artagnan but you know it and will interpret for me then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and d artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to athos say this to him in english you are a coward				2431.408564636153
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend				652.8174230278192
why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table				607.3112362595905
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to albert				676.1078829708831
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams				3101.648626239837
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room				189.86586771600253
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings				32785.30237762662
i am ready to speak my lord ah				181.01342596899542
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisher s office				4314.800160387926
then steer for monte cristo the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island				3443.8466224176495
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other side what do you see				1291.2023589406258
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south				4646.606647438538
it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings				37578.570156143134
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee				53802.28270020319
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward d artagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight				3506.3892088202615
he repaired then instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel				45686.18873344992
d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side				927.2276352871518
don t disturb yourself julie said he				6.341518548603323
but come i am waiting for you both men entered monte cristo s carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no				444.9625120399338
edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment				810.6952306920475
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation				6849.664528084123
you have done well to warn me				49.88779826970538
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly				4536.942742054895
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				24468.56473700948
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door				207.19870192903278
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it				59.32092058610118
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that				546.2257753406034
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck				1777.1905249724298
nothing she replied with a violent effort				6173.019741385941
come fernand won t you return to marseilles with us no said fernand i shall return to the catalans you re wrong				2438.2109046460396
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle				2531.1200675046243
but said andrea ill temperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating				99340.77763305049
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around				2520.877098699359
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady				45.64709723888661
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry and i am so still said porthos bowing to harrison				6218.030597198297
this began to be annoying				46053.24916376532
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man possibly thought d artagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment				8598.215488831996
but i am eager to see our young vicomte				5620.818208867214
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept soundly				5692.495410488187
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio				4285.405042231288
what is his birthplace				143710.0678361979
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object				10448.256955317136
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had d artagnan in her power that she was present at his execution and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips				485.626391568926
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more who i am madame				767.9872096584697
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother s neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears				2297.593035671057
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy				18985.61023183452
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress				14171.37032989865
say no more about it				60.97561984741998
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden				2513.717070724775
i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations				21776.72278590679
then he bowed a second time and retired				1525.0972848898537
come now he said				179.36897888669566
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady				217496.48599215684
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos				52301.854156388814
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change				5312.135782633581
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz d épinay to pass a fortnight at venice				16571.202465813432
i told you of it yesterday				5126.562070231525
if i am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age i must turn gourmand my lord said la ramee if you will take a bit of good advice don t put that off till you are old good said the duc de beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that master la ramee s is gluttony				52615.88321620791
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately				1630.3891707843006
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure				2297.0442167841734
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up				1225.7873061293844
there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps francs will you have your supper with us				572.8304374249781
the queen				449.97665751430145
become of whom replied aramis				11.034623621698689
ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box				2115.7145526378213
d artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen				5064.28027088783
her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion				27609.151073163936
the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used				3095.3132334793695
do not let us do things in a hurry				3646.7877190787026
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation				14479.514151515948
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him				55.22993610113775
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties				4366.298708943834
god sends me this and i hail it joyfully how strong and courageous you are said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion				1731.8218170671132
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation				5587.697590884263
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows				36140.12956298885
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives				3747.876824319185
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic				6686.39945742022
all have forgiven me some have even loved me but i think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman s ghost rising before me a woman				869.3650675687937
gentlemen said he if monsieur d artagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur d artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal you have my word monsieur and here is my sword this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find her what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly				1385.0637332174085
seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to france after a few years				1241.7425023332144
mother nanette he could say no more but though he hadn t strength to speak he had enough for action				2051.8043532608913
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no				463.27150840536154
he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed we hear from yanina very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on colonel fernand which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary at the same moment that is at nine o clock in the morning albert de morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo s house in the champs élysées				3203.7331849555744
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you				178.2714961802715
yes we will fly i will confess all to her i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime oh what an alliance the tiger and the serpent worthy wife of such as i am				2260.6739047933775
it was then richelieu s object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom				5643.64626734153
he will be furious but i don t care				1238.0113196244608
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you				69.37709635905242
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his eminence aramis then joined athos and d artagnan who were consulting together				915.3236909944967
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences				33091.25686907179
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears				2266.666741886146
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing				11215.630956713825
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition				11431.85603398121
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged				53420.61482423588
oh i will find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i will find him though i dig forever monte cristo drew back in horror				4011.9295451195385
what did your excellency say inquired the other				659.3652927775746
yes replied albert raising his voice				255.85844149096968
athos went down to pay the reckoning while d artagnan and planchet stood at the street door				199.24394233132284
what is he waiting for				1178.5707140339714
mademoiselle eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel				37704.139821712015
be calm for i am sure that d artagnan and porthos are at rueil alive and well but resumed athos i recur to my first proposal				11111.361464547572
we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste				2104.65326637862
absolution father				591.5105163805146
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed				625.7593031647602
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself				591.6715912523608
tell me i entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived doubtless i may but but but i do not think so have pity on me doctor				2031.3725956817818
toward the town of louvres was the reply				1100.039479808003
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell				3278.21904601673
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer				1041.57143954618
i have been here since the morning				602.0101326028685
he listened all was silent as it had been for the last three days				1782.1192229883752
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what				676.8236524518286
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries				11120.605560411164
you see m morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a week s calm when captain gaumard comes up to me i was at the helm i should tell you and says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself				693.3622179332551
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count				237.27655517769418
the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither				37565.45584052102
mademoiselle s lady s maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied				5361.274350923291
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color				6660.833466455462
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them				104.8759421869433
do you mean is he a good comrade				12021.741993736956
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis				575.4682620816114
la chesnaye louis xiii s confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call				5448.959389067799
there is no god there is no providence all comes by chance there is a providence there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him but who are you then asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count				161.4032954778945
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty				2203.7937393515936
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promise not to reward you i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one				697.2918300711856
that pretty little soubrette whom d artagnan had already observed then came in				474.3372848855966
aramis you think that d artagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy among friends my dear athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head				337.5753645794046
and is not this daughter dead demanded monte cristo i fancy i have heard so yes monsieur one and twenty years ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it				62.11694285737215
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the ah said monte cristo the evening of the of june				34271.325260563266
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers				2359.148577762068
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband but how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since you are the ship s supercargo why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden				24446.243289621718
henceforth we have nothing to fear				2075.0462149490886
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you why because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning it is probable said albert				83.44622748279377
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse				51.74013310813876
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent				51713.57355793988
athos you have done wrong but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer				774.1597294757839
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers				1167.7073160196248
and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die but no she must not die she shall live and with me				93.73548245173176
i became very pale i felt my legs fail me i sought for a reply but could find none i was silent				1383.3324561668844
but when i have found them then tremble sir				291.8335777449399
well then the place will the place royale suit you asked d artagnan				2.0546285924617256
good thought d artagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend				585.0394647281805
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand				197.89845761880292
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with				2446.460898483115
oh no sir said madame danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality ah yes said monte cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination				2691.4330303518327
well those studs continued mme				84.5452466012064
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game				4199.0885002063715
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted				9980.260654944284
how so returned the count with surprise				1224.4028213652518
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleon s downfall				27793.548491667025
oh i can not tell what she says to me				53.73453990398748
her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources				11317.100797827818
the cry proceeded from the grotto				5059.501150031447

this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more				1043.7446041826609
why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother				726.3345983800186

and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and st denis the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second				2964.663329829255

they found him up less pale than when d artagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons				4911.367191551621
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory when do you leave immediately the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you				180.80501159357812
madame de lannoy whom according to your majesty s command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day that s it cried the king to him no doubt				1095.653652600915
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man				87.18421554789876
pardieu mute as a carp well i think andrea stopped and looked around				2432.0915388655208
do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard she opened noirtier s door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily				6799.919298692214
and i of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron s card				5310.985914328474
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos				659.7326257913625
are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile				384.6069371957151
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said d artagnan that matters little				1027.6187032163634
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then then asked caderousse shuddering				2803.5547807616035
madame said d artagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my life and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room				296.40667298589915
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together				1025.242960764595
rue des fossoyeurs				16184.953782676397
two persons passed near me allow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel oh yes very gloomy my friend				480.22621706909086
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better				1253.5277559194633
odds fish				6626.790037617237
they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you				87.92572332481933
expiation chapter				208.70422622494397
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread				8899.810701055514
two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles				1763.0139282923221
i know he can not save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence against whom against my murderer did you recognize him yes it was benedetto the young corsican himself your comrade yes				692.4833239267335
but we must not lose time				572.9599236588899
are you asleep that you don t answer when i ring and d artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently				2403.7109666008123
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate				5567.898794159099
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister				1565.175788808398
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise				1342.9235818481263
it was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand				198.1173174041323
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise				1341.3511487915853
well porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea				2228.9708882047207
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands				511.931409855776
how much were your animals worth porthos ah if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction no matter you can tell within ten crowns why vulcan and bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount there will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said d artagnan contentedly				17578.455665712983
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd				3414.81162439776
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately				1709.9062783749962
but there now take him he is your own for as long as you like				15953.446284909563
i am myself a frenchman				9627.258148855906
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant				49430.31069303728
they advanced towards a boat which a custom house officer held by a chain near the quay				2582.062420033134
and his name said he				6.795096396325366
the king came out first from his room				201.87634055452753
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting				8636.767377194175
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m dessessart and the company of musketeers of m de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together				869.9796412265835
my faith replied d artagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished				1272.923743044718
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment				763.0309423374308
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise				36389.48509915318
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse				3871.61466713623
it is impossible that your majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête				8526.789312575062
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted				42991.5297336648
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate				3613.86636358063
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home				2280.7524833160346
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur d herblay i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me really monsieur you say strange things said aramis				40.09961256382583
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared				532.9212785670543
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking				33424.34719091168
am i deceived				2735.9817419841015
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts				1418.9687598610774
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so				319.5535476628251
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing what is that madame money mme				163.3656817967218
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper				3445.3577355624516
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans				28860.202507124628
i hope it does not exceed she stopped speech failed her				117.0207226840132
the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice				763.6912363598673
this was all that m de tréville wanted				1974.4574582955872
he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul raoul cried athos				26.62749991973777
i am her best friend upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here no they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen indeed				1418.4857375308961
d artagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you				154.48709851189918
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared				523.9523261831116
but you will remain you are not afraid said d artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lackey				2592.6442465324526
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman				41536.22482271472
i would take the hundred pistoles				2610.2152725956394
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou				4832.1487895372165
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures				5209.191057129889
no no look look the recommendation was needless				43429.03703825882
on his part aramis wrote a long letter				723.4428618374428
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart				160.3696190119627
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son				954.0079426764765
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details				6894.4063687133485
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a dancer				8233.86069914016
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore				27975.84229406221
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary				4595.328507407239
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he				8.40096184589485
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos				16.042556158564203
let us to bed and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by d artagnan				300.34454695040307
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cæsar s commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander				40778.8609909802
did you see him they all asked				780.8039520922943
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence				928.4567046017282
penelon replied julie go and inform m emmanuel of this gentleman s visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley				15620.086208754932
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows				1818.576456205041
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor				1719.8004912855629
in brief i regained your harness and then mine				1888.1685507695079
d artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais what then the bodies were not plundered were they				3182.3898727612445
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand which whichever you please there to the left here sire i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right i mean on my left yes there				425.7840061802331
listen i am already upon the scent resumed d artagnan				1.1252359129219862
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions				7724.403287386243
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge				5816.606470740366
chapter lxvi				6443.365737110623
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft the duke had already begun to descend				6486.189702030147
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body				1329.1292915726794
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world				1018.3496505496335
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring				52791.801105134255
in france the first fear of the king of england charles i on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the rochellais he tried says richelieu in his memoirs to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure				2090.392798753113
latterly i heard his friend monsieur d artagnan give him that name that is it madame that is the same				1194.4437410243509
see him and hear what he says m				316.2504858787411
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood				4225.831676305215
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says he is quite right returned beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he does				4478.453059737318
i say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret which you will guard i hope young man as your life but which i must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty is this secret your own no monsieur it is her majesty s are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to me no monsieur for on the contrary i am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery why then are you about to betray it to me because as i said without you i can do nothing and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it keep your secret young man and tell me what you wish i wish you to obtain for me from monsieur dessessart leave of absence for fifteen days when this very night you leave paris i am going on a mission may you tell me whither to london has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my success and you are going alone i am going alone in that case you will not get beyond bondy				33802.63989500559
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them but i am unable to leave london for want of money				754.1050436056762
it was mordaunt				1964.7763430799005
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you aramis does the same to porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you				105.23165618157572
athos and aramis were more and more astonished				2175.9854706165315
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends				15110.989331147981
clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen				428.0425892444215
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort				97.0158995472793
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said andrea				340.2369531277049
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated				13188.53884667624
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me				52.73028370052716
they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia and how does he behave towards travellers alas				1676.732953516891
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching				4974.595133361239
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper				1829.3332388179633
well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am talking				17179.342720601966
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed				3773.4588902673636
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on				775.2517007371454
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully				58478.402272708765
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness				16489.353341356164
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care and what is her name haydée replied monte cristo				44.19851902375147
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu				3493.308714783205
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately				1926.6675556329922
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieux colombier				43411.06571140444
good thought gondy she is going to yield she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me				107.10038936842217
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use				7052.526531257522
yes yes the mortuary deposition				69394.96936781368
i began to fear that he would not come				1509.3755965826208
bazin was stationed in the corridor and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that after many years of trial bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been ambitious				4186.05789007988
well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head what fortune has she but i tell you a million andrea shrugged his shoulders				1002.7193743510946
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered				10176.812493279813
d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion				1722.2837984692285
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous				62476.05503548799
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period				5619.606882239122
there was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria				1796.2001901923595
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of				1994.3005911545326
dantès possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry				23808.43071570265
you are ungrateful d artagnan said athos yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner				826.3773472295771
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud				6483.94467699974
whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot				3590.523440697558
and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there				509.7019588241437
beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young man s paroxysm of grief approached him				51.88733561023442
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends				471.08670846482534
there are the horses				1064.2646473389777
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance				3108.254866257426
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait				1914.9274881567924
d artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know				1331.351906802846
two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you yes it is i and you come asked milady				51.97529298494462
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror				1052.095332137239

his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiority in fact the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others				1425.2446885355632
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that				840.2895447930562
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais d artagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation				808.7801110558205
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow				3380.855476778313

d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m de tréville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis				855.3115576080704
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees				2309.1078308075475
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in				499.9828811661938
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him				46.72330373947139
in france chapter lxi				2014.6495730073714
it is long since we have had a good dinner and i for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry i confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy agreed as to the old burgundy i have no objection to that said aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of conversion				70393.19552036904
from that moment he grew very guarded				9657.567221390897
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains				3572.2813401619046
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked				47252.77037203777
i will not die alone i will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands				550.4429428535612
this letter told buckingham that the city was at an extremity but instead of adding if your succor does not arrive within fifteen days we will surrender it added quite simply if your succor comes not within fifteen days we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes the rochellais then had no hope but in buckingham				1375.637651822745
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it				61.72245248080377
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street				2356.1120984496624
tell me have you ever thought that seven times francs make nearly twelve millions				2685.3541400523586
yes noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything				1592.952388293861
why diamonds and she is covered with them to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame danglars				245.34854318795902
meanwhile sir watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here				898.8322666456654
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake				9511.504448237996
the rest of mademoiselle eugénie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of diana as château renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute				18093.54265643354
ah my dear replied d artagnan upon that very horse i came to paris what does monsieur know this horse said mousqueton				117.58908052046118
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought me from the scotch cheaply i know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government				6977.2123513008755
to wait replied athos				9.510934355356744
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy				11140.795405032375
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then the devil said porthos what can we say to mazarin leave that to me i have my plan				2958.360866533376
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone				1529.3334136926344
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade				30716.69180796337
follow the culprit s steps he first kills m de saint méran oh doctor i would swear to it what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the other cases villefort ceased to contend he only groaned				3349.3987812926175
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him				78.84035341057385
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly				5541.4755997583425
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said danglars but do not fear it				60.38164207757423
i would then rather die truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not				568.3552905028807
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m at that letter the old man signified yes m repeated franz				586.5889516124062
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation				1954.7847315434801
besides you must have seen that the person to whom i spoke was a woman that is true but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that since she lodges with him that does not concern me but who is she oh that is not my secret my dear madame bonacieux you are charming but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women do i lose by that no you are on the contrary adorable give me your arm then most willingly				6990.646361967595
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor				1536.74364495571
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious				32103.870319744463
they directed their horses to the city				1430.9491639595788
are all these crimes committed on his account ah then you at length understand heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him valentine you are an angel but why is my grandfather allowed to live it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana				46137.872433433935
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs				1164.7610796504757
pardieu said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels				44144.76077883974
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty				2361.6033256709966
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter				736.2643333919852
and how by the queen s almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring				31440.979035499025
my friend				479.785842915511
on the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond studs				9148.06660830368
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly				14852.006813369646
yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle yes madame and i were there two years ago				5234.52901234452
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude				159428.53489282285
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey				6226.587505078782
could never rid himself this horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago and has remained in it ever since which ought to make you love it				89.84967094004081
d artagnan shows himself chapter x				6786.871227923707
here i am albert said				201.45130995223172
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued d artagnan with his frank expression				3105.902132444515
the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure				57596.546036908316
the president read mr				6874.480039541585
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled mazarin started				865.6202751273489
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades				58802.592505509805
the initials are only mine c				45441.5917540694
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp				2836.921428290288
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared				543.276753999307
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out monsieur de gondy				2121.823880228217
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop				765.598150915936
well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal				257.7505911463765
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort				337.8674877201396
then what asked monte cristo				42.76216087173542
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other				613.6899667863987
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can				2037.3403806301942
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story				2648.981091466424
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl				5272.887904090093
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house oh yes yes you are right				1264.895789599994
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept				3941.5686922658783
really count if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you				310.24975785012106
what did you answer him that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see well what did he say then that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal replied the young man smiling				784.466053489647
this lad for he was scarcely a man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge spite of villefort s severe look and stern accent				5770.532251726762
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity				32410.79033000713
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him				51.05542834590865
in one case or the other the trial was soon over				1070.3754475110045
ah haitians that is quite another thing				1882.077631773752
go for i see how impatient you are then i have leave go i tell you may i have the use of your skiff certainly then for the present m morrel farewell and a thousand thanks i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond				1127.531777350788
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you				126.42915379161502
grimaud sprang up				940.1063827438296
why is that gendarme there asked andrea of himself				178.73402033000173
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell				2179.302060373747
he told me let me think what was it				89.51393418390666
when seven o clock came dantès agony really began				4414.090741068344
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers				2425.1351187816294
you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d hôte of the hôtel des princes or the café de paris				511.5648910297166
conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song				7966.175123066339
in that case i should beat a retreat				2709.276936368177
yes i dare say verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de chevreuse				2372.8154107734363
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission				6640.492871060858
let us understand each other my lord replied d artagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake				4036.5336447634354
the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and four and twenty hours afterward i will answer for its being carried into execution				2435.2085199357466
bring six of them why this man is a cask said the host aside				5586.940946315887
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible				2880.773500455867
as regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know monsieur d artagnan that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you				83.59720878850264
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead the devil cried d artagnan				1.4128993616426955
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children rest assured put the gag in grimaud in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate				46677.724520607786
your d artagnan				2.8832331246690264
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing				374.428987116083
his wife				1150.089476645049
nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself				236.7474139181499
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune				2233.300913050513
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church the mendicant shook his head				337.4826594680424
you would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to paris oh my god				363.79975196325597
in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait				15261.798255832413
d artagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds				8138.4998845746895
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet				3000.606945535295
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction				15021.690103226138
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half				5470.5886000280925
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de l arbre sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all				535.9835088650595
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx				6122.63903242872
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting				24122.526074563615
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs				1944.5713022302064
the young man remained immovable				4438.091569468996
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection that is possible said the countess reflecting				38513.47673265029
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued				13289.5949235242
how many shots a hundred that s quite as many as we shall want				5430.9054307372
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture				1526.8603646671563
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf				96742.56954488475
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position				4164.571656561481
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance				69758.12050416498
carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence				4726.748446706604
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran				7397.584773762783

would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo				138.1033554658082
thanks replied the jeweller				22531.052887287067
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open arms				489.94727855358894
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand				201.82436569048147
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti danglars kept up the title of prince				925.5490374959004
compared with such things what is the letter you have just read a lover s deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her				118.82884871268787
i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago				4783.683780982378
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos				475.57974175959265
he was in a most elegant hunting costume and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him				56.70621170112884
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again				355.2337528411783
and with how many fingers does he bless				53525.104966162835
do you still wish to do so i have no wishes count only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your word with me do i not ah count i shall forget it no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again oh count have pity upon me				91.41865165839133
then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber				730.822469426984
when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him				67.71716282030083
do you wish to speak to us asked morrel				80.9670284051392
d artagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character				3114.25438837795
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket and took from it a paper folded in four and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential he said good				1997.782226067726
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant				4381.737001711248
d artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress				6751.333676606339
i do not know you i am said i the little abbé who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into verse ah ah				196.13615189314092
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point				2435.8890769896047
she had in her first marriage i don t think d artagnan i am telling you anything new married a lawyer they thought that nauseous you can understand that s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men				478.36357264615907
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing				8582.911716319892
on my soul handsome stirrups				66909.31814650075
where do you suffer asked the doctor				2145.4803297932576
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and d elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have				3970.517077128872
is it from thee				4617.640948461047

all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting				6039.068737060039

much monsieur mordaunt would care				1220.816878240976
madame said athos passing his arm under that of d artagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman				858.6820813735368
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear				8283.274474066839
i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india will have taken some galleons and my mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine very good very good				1997.063129833612

they said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon he spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the count				529.270242578476
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				3034.7758250630764
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window				605.8124408227147
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk no sir no said grimaud				118.80697918932684

bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return				1660.2134572556495
athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door				199.4563008678236
voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed				13933.154847510305
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m morrel				247.26635075848546

andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney				3934.0991818514076
no no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone the honorable the king s attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris				497.6144178315497
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them				113.88926665078964
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee truly honor				1439.510619066919
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans				6233.015884934792
ah sir he exclaimed it was you				67.28338498223242
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster				24115.64855013284
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning				2730.2161964462143
in three days m bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual paving stones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening				37934.32016222433
and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still hope				1714.478322358777
what is that exclaimed the queen				254.8920568136573
the lion was daunted the avenger was conquered				9558.18852652622
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse				140.1107746501037
nonsense said d artagnan you would do as much mr				7130.679890933524
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you				98.89380451294448
bonacieux help then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his				1048.5524396221613
doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast				927.0874885802973
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought d artagnan				138.37539760812837
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh my friend aramis paused				2392.0392038762857
did your excellency desire to see me inquired he				11.06694361233387
oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone				1048.5224407253688
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur l abbé is repeating to me said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse				2192.4977700246927
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event				1836.790811577167
greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence all eyes were turned towards athens it was the fashion to pity and support the greeks				49085.41461485315
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs i will accompany you but however near it may be replied d artagnan i can not go thither in this guise that s true said athos and he rang the bell				3162.431068779107
now really let me ask sir have you do you believe you have anything to do				1006.6727077449143
all at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone				3626.8655770224605
but hush here comes somebody tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond				1341.4656431643034
by degrees everyone awoke				10783.159087882445
i don t care to be shot in a box no said aramis he has not seen us				562.6790038037774
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and i at least i understood it so when will it be our turn to think of these things				2598.115557289618
the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism				33474.30220871095
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear not at all my good friend how				1679.8219757645088
but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a day s journey before me who followed him on foot				2383.10667279425
oh those figures how well i remember them				142.0953265434271

dantès saw that he must attack the wedge				25780.641257051422
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers				2989.932172800466
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space				6603.435391095091
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch				4520.634256172239
the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other not that m d artagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m d artagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings whereas mme				237.57204035816267
and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure m				605.5233470658827
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked albert lighting his cigar				15989.468930124951
why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course is that possible true as day				474.7839776465187
the devil exclaimed porthos there s vulcan foundered zounds cried d artagnan then we must stop				3063.2747409591543
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us yes but the son has done us no harm grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands				610.7589813453928
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression				9576.15360897816
olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use				6397.9622326881645
why what good would it do asked caderousse				48.24886659940423

she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil				1140.9021899660254
lord de winter perceived nothing of this				1271.8868413208563
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles				5938.143158546808
now jump down athos athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall				903.1039212405659
but i wonder she is not here				612.1637529457045
as to d artagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying				45747.83791008667
be philosophers as i am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us drink				4396.282246390445

mazarin is better lodged said aramis				9.697605096415295
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m bertuccio i cried the steward with a strange expression				3363.2423805479284
d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step				1294.1629226049506
but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my father s it was herrera				47934.45318281058

i will describe my captivity				4723.8373185617365
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears				4597.643021979839
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance				1735.7223131461433
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition				3674.348954976664
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan				7801.389311279438
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere				3490.9408362314775
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced				38305.272129758785
the castle of bragelonne				3107.2234739489336
the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust				10248.837341493387
returned the influence of m de saint méran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable				13466.280606764221
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead				602.3549913623552
i stand in need of being taught and consoled consoled for what for my misfortune your misfortune is laughable said athos shrugging his shoulders i should like to know what you would say if i were to relate to you a real tale of love which has happened to you or one of my friends what matters tell it athos tell it better if i drink drink and relate then not a bad idea said athos emptying and refilling his glass				1585.652900150357
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn silence for monsieur porthos s idea said aramis				16.41754487734797
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus				18864.29038443048
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips				499.9630934932245
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time				463.66687618735176

from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart				165.9658549247859
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration				1987.6170808305894
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and d artagnan a captain				2383.901116500254
that knife was for you my lad she would have killed you				83.28153915487876
if you would but accept my offers				65353.88051494986
tell them oh tell them that corpse belongs to me the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy				4860.160551850088
thanks d artagnan thanks cried aramis almost in a state of delirium				8478.631180822083
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder				41499.63942804476
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him				47.78525409384303
my lord the cardinal mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors				51470.025228834755
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her				208.32709586589198
yes replied beauchamp				153.63113185226675
i make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me and how do you make your twelve thousand francs				1037.570600624133
well this is what you have to say said d artagnan my lord your sister in law is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been d artagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos				124.68789441337154
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature dantès pressed the gendarme s hand as though he would crush it				74.44520579708976
i opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying				3368.3846231523316
now grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed				714.465104264473
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible do not think so brisemont said d artagnan do not think so				218.70023193967265
will this promise be fulfilled m noirtier asked morrel while d avrigny looked inquiringly				6807.536844699161
he had my love				770.2118240003748
to day the third will be there also as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out yes if your majesty releases them ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris why so on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain paris with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand				227.7224961830018
well asked the queen well madame replied the valet i followed them as far as the gates				6899.082791985245
friends well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible				1082.37782349895
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from noyon in picardy you have several lawsuits and no attorney				3762.8506124894056
i always knew you were a good son and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence dantès smiled				531.1621433860988
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet				1873.7177114114108
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion				1920.8471710546412
so that now it is no longer hatred but vengeance indeed and the queen believes well what does the queen believe she believes that someone has written to the duke of buckingham in her name in the queen s name yes to make him come to paris and when once come to paris to draw him into some snare the devil				1164.5178392552225
we have arranged the ransom of each of them on arriving in france				547.8793338348148
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as had done over the moor who would have killed him				63.873538922810326
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you but on what day will this ball take place asked anne of austria				2078.161389403061
she should have wanted nothing have you ever seen the queen of england inquired d artagnan				1.582658971797863
oh yes tired enough he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day				475.1952883763316
a black satin stock fresh from the maker s hands gray moustaches a bold eye a major s uniform ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted				8009.505051470167
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night				937.927592359798
she read it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone				932.371519556756
besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible that is just the case precisely so but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you				116.91608901190072
is this possible count on foot yes in a carriage no i will go on foot then is it important that you should go that way yes there is something i wish to see well we will go by the corso				7180.728452463909
happily d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties				66394.95731635312
what he is that is quite another thing				1877.8160125085517
i am a great captain that i am				2351.3589539155973
he then asked with whom he played				6623.681425632834
please to know monsieur porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurator s wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected minxes that doubles the offense said porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurator s wife for if you are rich madame coquenard then there is no excuse for your refusal when i said rich replied the procurator s wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word literally				55265.21614578086
i like men of head and heart				184.62708107588455
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled has he eaten anything lately asked madame de villefort eluding her husband s question				1216.402430732545
d artagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for				961.5366267271692
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone				1117.2741396705655
her reputation would be lost it is true but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer				13609.121694019377
i also intend from this time to work on my own account				1908.71293294122
i must tell you resumed mazarin that it is in a double envelope i understand and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place just so take it and go				1454.6828485969656
the guard obeyed				1202.240085491878
your eminence is right				1126.0638764891494
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was				1377.206278293523
i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob go and lose not a moment				821.428018432656
you know me well enough we no longer know anyone madame you must be mad my friend said the baroness				879.0652600888086
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead				610.8609212536392
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republic s which deputed to devise a uniform for the academicians indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly and what is his especial talent his talent				13799.593430863793
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth				3129.718756341169
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate				37296.01806721565
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well				637.3982139639223
there listen and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode				2862.389652947782
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle				2558.668680049505
i will not make a confidant of him alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain				3192.5823928040318
they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received livres well sir and what then ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything really your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want				4735.266799195136
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital yes monseigneur you came through meung where something befell you				102.74212166034066
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron				4224.642973719368
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one				758.0625597716331
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer				1691.6550018864004
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you you have said puritans have but one word				622.2773221980839
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches				35189.80121595582
then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor				34924.54406650875
i too said the young man am a musician at least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he said the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday				4511.043373622429
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and don t you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell				4187.411442935929
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper				1578.7827957958589
you will assist me in the work will you not most undoubtedly				45831.37548229322
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits				47747.52892458513
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback				2929.1782095379817
for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse				8133.580594647428
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief				2816.258045631754
he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii				986.3666947149494
you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again as your excellency pleases said vampa as he left the cell				2788.779004186629
but then your word is given yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not				522.6056735781962
now then all is agreed let us go down you are going into the garden yes go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it excellent thank you and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles				6563.667089362263
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis				519.258745721855
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				9060.538601144744
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers				2155.8770669793225
i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to wait let him be sent for instantly your majesty s orders shall be executed but but what but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey my orders yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that whenever it shall please your majesty but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france very well cardinal very well but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals				17067.156000412975
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening				716.8593424866347
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking				14898.452146613829
and yet as you come from dax or pau from tarbes said d artagnan				1.6428715010092023
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber				773.5626781577745
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road				1862.4343865156663
one of them stationed upon the top stair naked sword in hand prevented or at least endeavored to prevent the three others from ascending				30360.74242994426
if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble				3013.4830856434974
my lord said athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain one must replied monsieur de bouillon sacrifice one s comfort to the public good but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted				5704.135756763188
the latter had surpassed himself he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with monsieur de beaufort s coat of arms				504.3533390497053
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain				1257.396235169548
in which we hear tidings of aramis				620.0602947266839
he found d artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante room				201.5698822199527
ah s blood how you have hurt me				50.70963792571265
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again				458.50214658886136
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness				4363.659513814147
well you are right it is more difficult than i thought				2278.821816518267
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan appeared to authorize the issue				29068.22611278384
of what consequence replied milady				43.141086343058056
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two				4102.685230792972
so much the better are we then to go to war by my troth yes against whom are you a politician friend not in the least are you for mazarin or for the princes i am for no one that is to say you are for us				546.2890709689976
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door				209.80990294167958
the major recovered his self possession				3025.915205774875
good heavens said aramis to athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber my dear friend we must take people as we find them				97.57834314576132
the note is changed				7995.935378758528
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house where you can be relieved asked de guiche				787.1583022991728
at any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in paris is there not in that respect my dear friend it s delightful				31487.189019985763
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators it is a conspiracy then asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm				3330.9805381922156
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo				53354.935063311284
i ruined				4565.471897553628
i have already got up again after three stabs from you i shall never rise after this fourth count said d artagnan with some degree of emotion i struck without knowing that it was you				139.4608888028088
i faith yes said athos for i am hungry look out for the black fowls cried aramis				19.450673165849274
thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it				80.01320295705915
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details				7107.169136173645
it was about five o clock				1084.5187308817995
without doubt she murmured				3257.037946011304
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment				644.5421318723052
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine grimaud hastened to awake d artagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place				763.717456067796

you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse				212.26414755533185
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as i am that you have met with me for if i leave this place well i have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal				254.83931304169235
well you do not reply resumed mazarin				118.89232711353749

now go down said the abbé folding his arms				484.8723082630331
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him				44.34816544310172
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way				674.0387111815797
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought d artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned a perfect stillness in the house				385.78944757884784
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets				11931.521573768163

gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats yes your excellency and it is true i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome				1755.2782852607722
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration				39726.78035907728

i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				8381.83429910641
die in peace i am lost murmured milady in english				9374.18355731588
will you take me away with you				104.99793440627417

this is fine said porthos to himself i am prettily caught he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme				386.46074453091313
where stammered morcerf				633.0631033464107
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm				2118.680634978656
in fact a moment later m morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own				844.5060399086466
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio				2516.9626670100192
the host obeyed				1166.8189913281624
i was for twenty years cardinal spada s secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government why from the french government because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbé faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance we are coming to the point whispered the governor				2243.9252618043097
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god i will go said the monk				2126.383736486999
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger				1931.383527114655
adieu thus tis quite decided said d artagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i repeat i am made up of contradictions				49094.777807614075
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room				205.22211183880344
this beverage required a good half hour to prepare				61144.554996046005
d artagnan took his hand				249.6378892908573
madame he replied monsieur d artagnan s prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment				8184.687062634276
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger				4521.76824734024
it was now nine o clock				1089.203236928465

the devil said porthos				13.55651594630092
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously				48915.50276366374
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès				1106.1051335073405
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired				1363.1742391303367

before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king				498.1357599160836
the boat continued her voyage				5186.428468357165
the king however who sought distraction while traveling as fast as possible for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty third stopped from time to time to fly the magpie a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes and for which he had always preserved a great predilection				48230.49225223245
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time				445.0703098226638

this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape				1927.6701253835756
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned unquestionably so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time precisely but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman				1911.9439497517164

for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions				67342.83580595053
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil				1185.1151643081487

i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper				2472.8829011401767
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend				681.960652552879
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight				2464.7036370983465

this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued				26181.93268299904

he took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the dice				2969.5982844102696
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers				40263.47296158343
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the diamond the devil said d artagnan becoming angry again				234.66981271990934
stay said d artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms				504.316785223654

without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell				2436.6523167713467
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged				3892.6324680976936
porthos kill every one who stands in your way and after pressing the hand of athos d artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist				49656.67718103237

the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks				1656.7433222729387

edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes				1408.817422797711

madame replied monte cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question				1371.1667272223474
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism				36013.10516637195
d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen				49556.00516699801

the hôtel de la trémouille at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence				1902.3189742848906
it was indeed for him that they were there				558.468476364832
neither gold nor rank you have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy				647.2758773360041
mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel				2127.7621258513855

at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed				4552.120406602155
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos				256.78869190909904

from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino				3639.5227853895667
the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela whom he adored				9627.166336605362
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question				1242.554549131981
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it				90.37147371469767
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty				19115.474686268797

my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers that s true said dantès but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three others do you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it				88.9353158255688

i remember now milady looked around her as if in search of something				3475.951664982596
dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless				48903.09558143743
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace				7021.401095470234
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word				700.3581682884356

mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and m morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece but availing himself of the doctor s order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat				2017.8597708983561
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post				2487.087642447439
it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay talking of captain leclere has not dantès given you a letter from him to me no was there one i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care of what packet are you speaking danglars why that which dantès left at porto ferrajo how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo danglars turned very red				17916.66555282353

this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them				135.61145573504402
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever				1300.0430576684716
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord d artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside				79469.20949770896
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive you think then that i may rely on the count s promises certainly i do you are sure he will keep his word with me to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts				37588.60605683826
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf				29347.1882133794
four men surrounded him besides the postilion				32049.72458494849
teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended				30904.89229079653
instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance				3691.383360705401
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone in the morning when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast				5533.34303824782
at the rue guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay				34080.39806318494
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat				1776.3619311844886
ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis in which i am not initiated				35512.43673334662

de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence				3564.2911395561828

one day the old man fell ill and died				7456.5433581902325
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me				71.08880313607669
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no i shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you i could not discover the others				1475.8951388485193
so that i have no society i live alone i am sick of it my mind preys on itself d artagnan smiled				574.1408536550375
whither art thou going grimaud to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention				690.8131993506069
poor assunta had guessed all				295.1950650945634
oh oh said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer				1775.6785051388943
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur				871.0273242391659
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door				226.50470827916553
make free now you have begun no you are after all a good companion i will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold i shall not sell it do not fear not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man				127.14362636813348
so would you said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men				389.47192173857314
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions				23264.18503163585
well said renée i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance				10100.505274535499
i am not your uncle i know you not my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not				359.0766451601403
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses				1002.389994234029
edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead				626.7794179025425
i am very anxious to see this man				164.96941572939699
at last he sank				49496.5401689453
ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet i exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me i will never leave you when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word				624.6639953321163
no all is over said porthos				13.37531029238149
let us return to my ring or rather to yours				2052.6018851141325

we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting to morrow oh as to that sir replied chatillon for it was he who with flamarens was leaving the duc de beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it i hope that is true said aramis				455.33859084723997
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth				3023.7574437481117
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged the king was invited to come and see the hanging				43845.73341319897
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look				1428.1672839285236
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and grimaud was posted as sentinel				3648.2382700150965
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman				3580.7538452981057
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left and i about ten pistoles said aramis				184.94217014003655
pooh said athos trying to smile in his turn				823.9040736554807
porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual				4464.764159336369
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village armentières read porthos armentières				6441.491823570594
life itself may be resolved into three words erat est fuit which means said d artagnan who began to suspect the truth				2685.9509084654997
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard eugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands				545.9893281735649
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction				3822.722949668709
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word				778.1427126406463
du vallon next me				60.54494157934875

at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams				3276.9562425652744
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand				214.72088797091976
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable				5633.209079203714
is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied d artagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven then monsieur is satisfied asked planchet				895.1628467336303
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i don t believe in them the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemen an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained how is that cried porthos and aramis in a breath				3564.5766815181623
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing				945.8154291316035
for my part i wash my hands of the affair so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather				5126.884759044976
m danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation				6192.678403649439
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene				2790.3871879853054
who and what are you demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hour s time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim				6334.348322058089
do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three thousand the deuce does his island produce him such a revenue it does not bring him a bajocco then why did he purchase it for a whim he is an original then in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad				1364.1281405232266
besides be assured my dear edmond the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation				37105.150924027126
then they did not watch over this man				176.4253455847074

yes read it morrel opened the letter and read my dear maximilian there is a felucca for you at anchor				10637.507273099243
i have heard that she met with a strange adventure in i don t know what village with i don t know what curé of whom she asked hospitality and who having but one chamber and taking her for a cavalier offered to share it with her				166.89929934886257
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage				1003.2244108464013
you did well to defend the honor of a woman and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal				237.97884829871498
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies				39137.43964899368
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess				2283.3455820803515
athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau				5340.174100677505
here are five francs for his trouble indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark				5410.098647139453
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences				10148.492894171193
during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife				1370.1308088940814
his companions followed his example				1393.003878673075
de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment				6993.713762687322
athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement				34574.45916074927
the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year				3154.888191624338
you remind me of my fright				10805.714059508791
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken				2819.1454092956455
i will go with you and he took his sword and cloak				1244.3054227652758
ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me				110.67112835656145
then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller				11320.922104071311
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated explain yourself said grimaud				127.77954967226854
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled				38188.33339176666
every one arose				2284.4466080944003
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes				65213.54787798535
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance				13092.68305039468
mon dieu cried danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me				116.2051064302651
this desperate resistance could not last long				1729.8517610247213
was that all he said inquired athos				9.151800482765518
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once				1254.3564815975922
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel it is his voice said julie				1578.7602112883433
ten days passed away thus				958.9537239294317
i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn				7272.249228330975
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos				42.79449216880263
d artagnan related his story simply with the omission of names				22792.815789446628
but let us go continued de winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there				433.8461638420704
i am suffering i can not see				1029.4441278511808
they reached the queen s apartments but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england				1301.1022932445728
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me				74.19815838764066
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer				4443.148045563507
four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have with pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be despised				11385.626028420684
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful				4915.673531696057
the marriage will take place in less than three months said villefort				94.11814885020932
well bazin said d artagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends				477.0674340988846
then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther				6074.56936200976
great heavens suddenly exclaimed debray				161.59366040673555
while singing milady listened				4388.231408626743
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince				894.0716379789848
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected				6065.272667021812
the papers said something about it did they not then you believe the papers i not the least in the world only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches well that s what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly francs this month not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss diable said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune third rate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortune first rate second rate and third rate fortunes				7292.786023325887
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play				3277.797015488146
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose				2137.554133801085
m noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal				4289.088904235773
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life				637.224082911055
the four men stood motionless				3973.142044499342
bonacieux blushed				4542.696659343257
by no means				1711.9115758743878
do you understand it now athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails				11809.024886170833
oh spare me that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same m de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless				3005.7765849297675
nothing could be better done a sun dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision				66819.78928126936
i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths				44140.508911434896
d artagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage				2077.69173475417
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon				26547.764431536132
i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence you must still deliver it said athos				14.69261560719974
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded				27460.366850869465
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets				79975.86729621876
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me cardinal heavens				1914.0337634774953
how very astonishing cried he at length				4336.242587124397
you will get me out if they put me there said d artagnan				1.8346469305901913
what fine things we would do together yes said porthos				13.678961993907992
stop said he i will go with you excuse me sir said franz since m noirtier sent for me i am ready to attend to his wish besides i shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing so pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself forgive me sir said franz in a resolute tone				1024.2871691377904
very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me				94.79532961326292
i do not see what you have in your hand said selim				2568.5409481984548
yes continued mme				75.23874415996984
take this peach then she said				200.35595470773933
i want friends i want faithful servants				3740.6209731636472
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened				1571.5991960497174
he was carried home in the arms of the people				788.2731188879619
he then entered the room				197.04591550451292
they will have nothing to do then at this end said mordaunt				285.24322775108084
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud				17906.22864232113
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side				913.0795486645195
and blood too				1875.0440726516572
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh				1470.3549950206927
then my lord then what asked mazarin				62.05139951943355
of this treaty at least i have been warned				85149.94471845811
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy				40113.34762963455
i am dying				2294.164247214862
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter				882.1095087549529
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune				2241.832274061731
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so				238.57887634005533
years have elapsed many events have happened alas				1280.3492267197003
but what ails you father				638.4132529231197
by me what was his name lord winter your uncle exclaimed cromwell				580.1590156250734
keep the purse for your lackeys d artagnan put the purse into his pocket				792.7156879132359
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will				1032.8155816680944
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards				24660.52110491047
the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude				1865.4981082717711
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass				1440.2280985098969
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man				138.16079105757683
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire				56409.963363775074
your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want monsieur d artagnan i will answer for everything nothing is so catching as confidence				6893.347872033853
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent				26413.74166499846
although the musketeer was not expected before one o clock the procurator s wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his time				444.891863487414
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilian s situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window				616.1776698233147
i do not know do you wish for anything i wish to see the governor the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber				810.0109049027004
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others				1623.6039252775074
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me and you say you will wait for me at armentières at armentières write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it				60.27382524523215
you chevalier d herblay to his left				865.9542623117343
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me possibly monsieur				908.5713637859874
if i am happy in an error do not have the cruelty to lift me from it				93.7562239505396
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers				51331.59387199138
nevertheless monsieur de tréville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will				956.7823492765798
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master				2121.643793795397
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly				49432.38491493733
the notary she exclaimed let him come in the notary who was at the door immediately entered				463.5970158745711
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided				62955.79324677307
he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity and he raised the medallion to his lips				481.30206907308707
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step				1339.9524204978231
listen said he				6.847050613700373
dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier s eyes				623.8126877587401
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me				79.43021864859443
you give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of and who has filled your head with all this nonsense why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchamp s journal and thirdly from my own imagination				2775.229516431356
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chest now madame here are notes of francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron to this i add a certificate in the funds of francs then for the odd cash making i think about francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank notes				6603.699892515035
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him				66.8278763490769
it was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised				20441.17075236742
by my honor these gascons are incorrigible				48735.116188194406
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo				137.9544767112293
chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person				858.6378617476308
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly london sir if you please and my master lord d artagnan				183.19632911533552
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based				43268.14024746257
its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of francs i will not say granted but offered me three months				2886.047681794965
it is the truth however				73519.5772469797
what this one too he exclaimed				2709.806660553086
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count s assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said it was well then did he ask you who is m albert de morcerf				851.8673322572068
that would be a far better life than i lead now but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch who won t dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house				401.07817588047465
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles				26504.758836423913
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings				9214.629549270301
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him				201.2680158610329
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight and what are your feelings said monte cristo turning to the young man				89.20501259079822
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident				3643.679848208901
certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh				782.6979849177478
on your brow i read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble				2131.803035783921
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian oh i shall always love you				120.8683064251248
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain				1386.7039401652896
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i don t know anything about that replied renée but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand				1318.4432487517809
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men				469.35685914028164
well said caderousse why what a lie he told				32036.27880654115
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage				1814.9682988253244
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment				13930.896122985516
d artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passers by and he restrained himself				260.8428486970583
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared				541.6915848628361

franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				2807.5641517033864

mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant				1569.28451647526

and thus they parted the best possible friends and m de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers the countess made no reply				1080.527575477225
silence then cried athos				10.707929634029782

m d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m d épinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort				616.1030449746685

my faith it was time that idea came into porthos s head				338.9559090352847
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian				45344.9243623523
an instant after porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon and m de tréville alone remaining with the wounded				4206.086291399081

and yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes				607.2877800388902

eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher				49233.46816420377

you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die and the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and charming				4687.836077002228

that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms with money or with troops				61479.83182954354
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance				1600.764762554299

terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that d artagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you				115.98367402092164

no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse				20902.902000851896

he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume				2373.209186845982
all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words i poured out upon this man				208.36007872590295

the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture				3624.268911750564
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship				9807.051371175967
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old				3065.2531446392045
m de tréville being informed of this by his eminence packed his portmanteau and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort				3632.9998383704915
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman				872.3058419283329

but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance				1344.327334705007

and now go mordaunt before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir a favor from me mordaunt bowed				771.2099636178222
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor				41940.51915097649
do you say resumed d artagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman i tell you i am sure of it continued the host				1550.7303976963235
do you pity him				51.88355025144074
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the half uttered bravos expired on his lips				529.1417989257313
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal the coadjutor started				892.3594466925664

before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movement not a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him				46.47466111547103

but what can be the matter				925.4404751647979
porthos paid his compliments to m coquenard and bade him farewell				7756.507008224437
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				48408.964862653884
he was stopped by athos				401.39634906607483
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine				10215.951656735637
porthos was discontented with his condition				3015.104390753816
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered d artagnan				2.504062742350697
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew				4184.425424892607
there are hours which last a year				2958.432810883984
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword				1083.7479509177374
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one				867.4428751910957

but what are you doing				3979.7557045855456
general d épinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell				4412.041139442642

poor woman poor woman what have they done with you you have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old man				86.66593745616787
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory				26548.220158027387
we have parted company this long time all three have left the service where can you find them then wherever they are that s my business well now what are your conditions if i employ you money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require				6280.34459646178

she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic				3369.971893916618
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart				164.67249238001034
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared				910.3233427416943
and what kind of a man a genuine englishman your eminence				1941.6860075450588

as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign				2729.9844736815558
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes				1379.5566520027483

forward cried d artagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear				2262.4424724700834
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob				81255.44917179139
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed mme				71.60995033655556
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean he went to find aramis				312.30429704022015
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen				2488.8007234536044
it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness				990.8341583506153
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me				75.75869870964861

this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman				1329.9001893803368
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream				819.0554755896277
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis war for the king yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort monsieur de beaufort				3274.9005395827608

dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever				35893.64654225765
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears				5028.992616350064
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king				452.4889124141823
milady smiled with joy				774.8414769224114

he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything				1593.7364666133867
porthos smiled				574.3779888992922

accordingly it was admitted to the presence of anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them				101.09216246326356

he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp				47882.68735483673

he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes				677.9538436251705
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies				58034.3878612423

athos and d artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer				1819.9427538044545
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki				25937.807097564964
those were good old days never fear these people owe us no grudge is your honor sure i can answer for it they do not well we won t speak of it any more then and planchet took his place in d artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed				7264.208662156815
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting				2998.687424973484
how will this end he said				206.98915427681666
do as i do				724.6156556330989
d artagnan therefore followed mme				97.48723543381428
they left the chamber at the same time				440.5521857780087
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house				384.8160641927052
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it				57.572432017029655
and is the reason known no how extraordinary				4754.017726114895
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut i wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover again that accusation cried the queen				227.75062183565285
it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris a manuscript in folio endorsed or we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii				907.562473775575
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves				8854.864331697943
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own apartment				655.9130237635246
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation				11216.005325033235
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself				280.3832767429359
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only what is it that i am not forced to learn english well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again so be it said d artagnan but i i confess i have a contrary conviction our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye but in the meantime saves the country added athos				116.1457764937123
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also				1832.1433094983317
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer				44608.55104815862
oh my god				329.6225989443206
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here				795.6433703064812
it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth				6211.096394493138
he wished to see everything				603.6963884969189
what i hate to day i adore to morrow and vice versa				76436.01690684397
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal				454.22199912544056
have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges				5584.660975404808
nothing could turn him from his purpose				2354.635182977606
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands				582.8150245750464

yes a base coward murmured d artagnan but she she was very beautiful what she demanded the host				1642.5623007054637
caderousse quickly performed the stranger s bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off the name of edmond s betrothed was mercédès to be sure				3472.9628875645108
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil rue du helder on the st may half past ten a m chapter				223.0996477712376
oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis xvi than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule				33292.51396528557
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters				57459.27914446412
saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom				8769.815477244245
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the king s attorney you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us				536.2537216890951
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force your sword the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee				5024.850560832095
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it what do you mean sir inquired raoul				369.3788443669845
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but d artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her				148.8798337778974
ah really this is magnificent				3696.121306459931

milady uttered a stifled groan				3359.924320163997
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way				602.6161356993777
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause				4026.617884098434
the same evening all villefort s servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave				4377.409954597562
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia				38758.13318833876
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead				1471.602114787862
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do				819.3968927470868

tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered				2932.3673073119203

it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean				2723.348379315774
d artagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong				7468.328666520726
by aramis is meant simara which is the name of a demon				51058.71994149326
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her				134.20791751077388
what exclaimed porthos mutton again my dear monsieur de comminges said d artagnan you will find that my friend monsieur du vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat mutton every day i declare said porthos i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away remove the mutton cried comminges i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite is mazarin dead asked porthos				161.6460655284697
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance				16017.398499621922
yes you are right let us go porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid				4087.5128050600756
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended				5712.023602889642
after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only				4467.174798778596
the victory was complete twice he had overcome his doubts				14080.599076867742
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé d herblay and in spite of bazin s assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion				4406.73427888388
who could have thought it				75.39310002919565
tell him also what you have just told me that mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity which can not last interrupted comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison here but there are oubliettes replied athos smiling				563.9860978830759
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners bah said athos				21.04374657641691
i tell you valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m noirtier				2540.92602590139
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other and do you propose to make this journey very shortly i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice				2371.5847161880283
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets				46583.580597862645
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii still annotating				56385.975122671654
the people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves				1819.2538380607639
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m noirtier s room				239.4778165916825
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages				93109.9144156044
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth				4610.041973849545
that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelor s revenue could not suffice for the coming month s outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs				1023.2322410605883
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos				37.57014563229031
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post				2397.06317035959
that is never done				571.8779477289071
no one must disturb us he said i must speak freely to her accuse myself and say he approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand				206.73979070034437
ah indeed said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish				98614.3373340122
ah ah said the listener not through doors but through windows				2179.655407564569
ho there my friend the wounded man heaved a sigh				1514.2675702275394
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill closed door and the door reopened				32258.857247718384
there they are				1793.2810603804764
at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word				733.0715495212896
our former life has it still no attractions for you				176.12636245785805
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival				7856.340223874391
my letter of recommendation cried d artagnan my letter of recommendation				10044.024140801304
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen we from mazarin which were we all four together would never be granted				81658.08050473442
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this				1704.2554983142693
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired				3529.235639029652
what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m de morcerf begging me to attend the opera and i said debray				166.52845359564438
d artagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad				13732.664959871312
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword				1118.622830334866
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops that s well said monte cristo i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter				6378.247980484788
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages				34480.712997210016
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have it a sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl				902.8851859123808
mordioux answered d artagnan i believe we must				101745.2746187254
have i by any means displeased you				66.60823512098078
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one				789.3977954099005
the affair was not long i assure you				70.91447754476961
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart				174.66876133193884
but said debray to beauchamp if i spoke to the president you must have been with the procureur it was an impossibility for the last week m de villefort has secluded himself				250.14120669172812
that instant the arm of porthos fell				3591.7460846431463
why my good fellow you must be mad then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself this is annoying continued he				155.92357717562766
nay it must have been a promise a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh let them answered d artagnan				2.2622022314961936
have you traded it for your diamond no				367.38267588963976
can t you guess my dear athos				15.758967567402827
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper				2690.691341655132
go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms				536.9904039497145
another possessed all mercédès heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead				607.526148991346
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring				4630.548660161242
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament the queen shook her head despairingly				11854.068332728935
to morrow i plunge into an adventurous affair in which i may be killed				1083.5841467982295
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you on them depended my father s life replied she				61.378037654794554
what s the matter asked planchet				130.2150552801366
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion				2065.7670975608057
you killed that woman alas				1202.6070360385802
he stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances				6429.088604827475
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawing paper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarin s life				682.9981280803274
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests				8746.370393446292
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him				41.98772884208079
monsieur morrel said valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you				87.47762923481082
the two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone				762.3126936224193
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no				429.71933491145546
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles				1810.5529885425265
noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man				357.46787088685215
i do not hem said d artagnan there is some truth in what you say ah				181.6072017767283
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five and twenty years of exile				59718.74504723221
nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day				514.5284483088492
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us				599.0929351626369
the count was no longer young				4152.404458134
but d artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall				898.6492745174303
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure oh my legs my poor legs				53565.3439520714
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling				532.4638109089586
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room where there were several people				794.9368762601555
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her				171.28611448412406
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled				52786.16263356544
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d artagnan milady was livid				5540.2708047934175
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes so you are free now and rich alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year				3014.3942437755127
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way				590.9957095777211
this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn				5494.23154046879
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to d artagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said sir				380.29002344682806
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts				1377.3560147461487
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody				12500.586066297577
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one				800.3980276400948
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé				1430.7922367264794
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				1926.9946429732063
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall				975.887693143316
tis indeed they said she				37.31148988853467
louis xiii like every weak mind was wanting in generosity				4629.895133054422
in strafford s company said mordaunt tauntingly				382703.84116395673
yes but listen this was not all				266.947971412255
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen s commands the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen				5070.7610069056
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows				3162.1083808096523
no sir but i am severely what can we do said d artagnan we must return to paris i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again				581.5349991413868
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre				60516.978741073406
when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name				762.8534083389962
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly				42620.08541382157
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them				102.10301805682165
with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room his shadow did the same				1313.853072222593
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face				617.5118634204289
i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more				1008.3527343567802
there it is all blood stained on the desk as a testimony of the crime ah very good hush gentlemen here is the court let us go back to our places a noise was heard in the hall the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem and the door keeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since the days of beaumarchais the court gentlemen chapter				273.6365238995449
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then				665.281834415183
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching				2964.8541802930245
then with a sigh poor haydée murmured he				17.888812885753154
m de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor madame said albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years				1422.6000657020313
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect				6628.812682059498
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is for the three last days yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed what is the matter said albert entering no carriage to be had just so returned franz you have guessed it well your eternal city is a nice sort of place that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please ah that is something said albert today is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future at least we can have a window where in the corso ah a window exclaimed signor pastrini utterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction				4944.886234730324
they re after me was andrea s first thought				2195.679333457728
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base				10104.975786477087
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive				18856.73593399392
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place what was the cause of your quarrel when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends why do you not seek revenge i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre and what was the result of those duels the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one				701.0431144441842
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner				976.0152044999544
well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping a louis into his hand				199.94594714296002
thanks to the influence of m morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed				8294.246304187147
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear				3267.9401132570188
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet				13868.368985046105
what do you mean by that you idiot asked d artagnan				1.3685489827631276
he passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback				2935.9350432581577
i thought i had quite said groslow				524.5570376847055
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped				117698.36855754617
a mantle piece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begging a grayish paper red and black tapestry such was the appearance of lord wilmore s drawing room				192.5311960083882
vampa then rushed towards teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed				3958.1693460519955
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background				58836.69813385949
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution				11013.77379613302
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night are you quite sure of that certain				11223.92346669235
i wish to thank them all at once				959.9373473009848
the first who advances is a dead man cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back				1058.8080392420607
the great man has called me his friend yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified				79722.74413687125
you have been to sea yes i have just made a little excursion to the borromean what of that				998.1464425071275

franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host				1346.3345997079596

but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts				64980.55668192328
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear				3514.765769709313

when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties resounded				9425.77423147137

no i am wrong				2317.9155161309714
do you not father yes resolutely replied noirtier				272.2493951642404
but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon d artagnan with sticks shovels and tongs				39258.2206787464
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse				71169.32886517452
between six and seven o clock the road of chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy but suppose we all go said d artagnan what the devil				1831.1694664843294
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girl s head already her cheeks were becoming red				11565.861066688998

as to porthos oh as to porthos faith that s a droll affair and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passers by offended no one				741.718423814295
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening				708.8337714869966
this evening you said well this evening will come thank god				306.12405869655834
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily				9464.416545139216
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon				3043.1921953833375
what men call the chances of fate namely ruin change circumstances i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me				81.38604144735571
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph				7394.862088700169
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration				4240.292061503088
this time d artagnan was not hasty				51408.65570741448
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness athos smiled				658.081864732613
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored				8759.409039389775

i am a brute				37942.2075652285

each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passers by through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note				4370.994090125857
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers what matters it if you avoid them hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold				6069.832404392419
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him				77.33398919989499
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed				43123.09437035231
on the doorsteps d avrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others				1447.9727725584048
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfather s wish				2422.6201092759165
forward cried d artagnan and spur for your dear lives they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward scotland				20057.850154494936
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm				5835.898090457323
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege				10343.503517163343
that he has given the diamond to us only inquired caderousse half bewildered with joy yes nothing more true				1547.245613413702
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence				71324.72235403598
it was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today				3796.3362092560405
mousqueton exclaimed d artagnan draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage it is he cried porthos				29.28180220809492
you appear to think much of your horse				960.678246357513
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town				10382.709444416658
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us go away from here said d artagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood rascal eh				2521.740316832567

and why if you knew me do you let me die because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal				25114.21617632974
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de château renaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride				33921.738200202104
ah he said some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know my lord replied guitant such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance they get their information on war from warriors on intrigues from intriguers				64437.68444867231
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring the goldsmith knew the duke				912.1004459113876
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st mark s column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d if				1983.070151842504
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale				1064.1413366172173
it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by valentine during the minute and a half madame de villefort remained in the room				194.6291110220277
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you why i think there were not many intruders				51138.59081314379
my father has revealed the culprit s name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret				1455.4981119968636
no count of monte cristo added debray				579.5374590032031
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds				6361.566542664677
this is not his writing said athos				8.28435598789986
it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp				3114.7444743661054
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				870.743279238561
d artagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms				473.06265752207685
i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his				1191.6970915560273
today i am at your service replied the count				155.10683116878167
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him				64.48117062376573
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war				2819.114491179622
do not refuse this little service				1014.429786917492
good day to you have you slept well excellently athos but what are you looking for				1012.9163964429243
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold				2547.8403701749958
there s not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel but asked the sailor where are your companions				3400.6033309512773
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy				1937.6645036243879
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions				31953.132212069133
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what o clock it was he was shown monsieur de chavigny s watch it was then half past six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised				35536.219537282195
it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated				3983.49592097157
no a more material interest stirred his blood				1728.0174261220295
it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably				7913.926974581575
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse				801.1162512492168
during this passage felton related everything to milady how instead of going to london he had chartered the little vessel how he had returned how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder				3027.984987206665
i will continue then resumed aramis				40.23260874987865
look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel				664.7846019601486
while the rest slept then we went away a short distance we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away and what is become of this benedetto i don t know you ought to know no in truth we parted at hyères and to give more weight to his protestation caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation				8761.689875484031
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded				17715.78455114968
he awaited mazarin s promised visit to get some light on his present situation				2022.3254202453038
ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent who are their real foes				6522.0107429870795
alas i understand think of the offense you have committed toward me madame				733.9865579497439
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least i hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction having made this well turned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court				1373.5598447766054
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat				2837.9957147887826
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it				59.62788426961896
the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise				1252.437375709396

the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o clock				1238.037294408123
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked twice				6440.668702734252
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague				55930.638258438354
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death				836.6771764736563
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began				3674.275368936741
unfasten it or i will break it in said grimaud				106.6799958194156
the superior met her milady showed her the cardinal s order				2094.5035564468794
a retired baker asked the fruiteress				72005.70955829349
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other				582.033516295676
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance				1415.1118810293365

and so my friends we return to paris				595.1446205325542
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation				4684.618300280985

during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance				16898.71700147835
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor				1939.9665065505103
d artagnan and the englishman d artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her				187.07956435736497

the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demi god has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man				181.60633580817287
but he will not avow it how so because they failed your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for charles i				1028.9254013720486

yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos				29.494643753996012
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again				340.05156605080896
was there not some snare laid for her				142.1369350218193

do you see that street				3835.149190599694
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond				817.8222477103519
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man				231.196679793406
excuse me gentlemen said morrel but i do not see m de morcerf he sent us word this morning replied château renaud that he would meet us on the ground ah said morrel				149.02856408769415
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse				877.0153927041323
have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival				13018.340085339196
it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation				34298.463456394325
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night				904.7271440594923
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor				1005.7227187482958
come who is my father i came to tell you ah cried benedetto his eyes sparkling with joy				664.1230478754565
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m de villefort s multitudinously is good said château renaud				1284.1731056709377
it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it do not be too hasty m morrel replied villefort				123.57541480647288
the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant				2158.5700575458463
well his love is half real half fanciful				32825.09749901454
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled philosophy m bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life oh excellency no no but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive				60677.51937849614
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor				1986.766165851373
am i to say what you told me asked valentine				105.17186056704415
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms				500.0615627939027
i will send word to the governor very well returned dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad				1335.7471466255015
or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight				3689.1450794820785
half a million said he magnificent half a million is it said the major				810.6318357548275
it was only on the following day at about ten o clock in the morning as he was starting to call on m deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing				8509.63227758935
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained for as to the letter addressed to m de tréville it had disappeared				549.8180903156315
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters				6181.644402530461
yes before witnesses oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it there has been a crime said monte cristo				63.135229797513006
aha continued d artagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced				45798.212957788804
madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at court				1438.0115895599765
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion				1893.6126910522325
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces				43910.09137787275
the coast owing to the gascon s stratagem was clear				6971.013589493913
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				3792.8585330375986
the duke however was not dead				617.280467040867
another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground covered with blood and almost fainting				29624.730585647532
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace				2411.3807971295614
albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the count s kindness				5035.370569346923
adieu till we meet again				221.20150592544047
to what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments we have plenty of time to spare the two friends recalled by d artagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn				794.0772645739643
what m de villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination				47819.8942271285
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him				46.13198331607482
you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven				939.616990969243
four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers				7067.386033824289
i live as it were between two graves				8033.418502611402
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse				794.2552479241815
he is a priest said bragelonne he has worn the tonsure				51999.12061557579
twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth				8439.62607822775
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation				33745.24286412446
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience				3009.166736074075
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot s temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends				37732.08912973225
and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company				4896.3923963070165
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary				3428.830754406009
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes				7820.041294372763
one of the last as you see if you hear anything of monsieur voiture be so kind as to send me word to morrow oh said scarron he may die now why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes				613.7043058327234
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven				763.2500063644563
you will have pity on me ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask				7065.755145767401
the expulsion took place and i pocketed francs the day charles v repassed the bidassoa				35258.32945866162
the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it				76.16840752733809
now i recollect what to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphile s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding				45093.38071022162
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days				1862.4903362650211
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward mme				211.10627487670607
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum				4874.517803170336
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view				2322.3994998636836
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means				1602.9500659330572
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence				1904.2793118214925
they must be enemies he is right said porthos battle				7958.338734967175
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m de villefort				161.7212348800998
m morrel unhappy exclaimed the abbé				844.4436249768872
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk				3918.896124984861
he s in the bastile that is to say he was there replied planchet				132.73109167527488
not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious manner				805.2083583842289
do you take me for half a woman				849.626425045674
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead				1418.495883367801
the demands in that programme must be granted we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling				256.74510469387775
false gentleman cried d artagnan springing forward in his turn after the servant				2489.6719523647057
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought raoul handed the letter to the prince				938.6452376884774
why yourself to be sure				3273.551600028404
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twenty four hours				2947.6550641074045
why having recognized you and i the only one to do so why was i able to save my son alone				774.9486315613561
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands				530.2496082352541
yes shall my father be informed of your wish yes do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately yes then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa				18849.68784308374
at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic				61527.98733490263
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder				1282.6945405627785
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man				115.48578111581287
if it was mme				172.1483211839253
ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret				1339.0052087557497
and who has seen this fleur de lis inquired aramis				14.003282456409828
the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons				5465.57720619295
no replied d artagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people can not see whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion chastised monsieur said d artagnan the expression is strong it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face ah pardieu i know full well that you don t turn your back to yours and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly				10305.192520111754
but m de tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him everything				795.5678748160394
do as you think best d artagnan at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther				5799.977746641553
mercédès read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy				15923.577999545396
proceed said he to the host				966.171238012876
la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person but la ramee gay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the duke s eyes his incorruptibility				98313.84900164616
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold				61881.593626947666
woe to you m de villefort if you do not strike first this is what i would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths has contemplated three murdered persons has knelt by three corpses				11576.00213940336
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish half past seven had sounded				4810.882354516535
the next morning at nine o clock he entered franz s room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days				1841.8224428273732
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried				48818.661177453825
a sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat replied				5544.467583023793
see my lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself be at ease felton said lord de winter				469.81588737882987
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance				1682.3013013954721
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions				1518.6365415677506
say on you will permit me to make one remark certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction				5252.456089145489
soon the two gentlemen stopped also				1309.3300711019467
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him				43.62353756393406
what do you want of me she asked in great distress				25494.896112306826
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk				5591.668990073478
you have brought me something yes if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief here it is said aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it is				1070.0360887855256
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute				21703.8251307838
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction				40488.267082666796
i will not answer for them				126.1259772755344
how replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed				947.084491598127
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets				13577.982608260281
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on				958.7374620830948
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy				11451.22394687784
but on my soul it looks so				218.98615793303253
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two well but there s his comrade true said porthos				17.189825612495966
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin i think i know what you want replied athos				49.081173648809965
it is to throw ourselves into the wolf s jaws said aramis				13.615351575563373
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them				111.18791467680443
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig s departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation				5688.588025733949
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal				50404.32288882028
charles shuddered				5422.417993113827
until then you will not see me				49.31495851751447
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another				1071.7278265269345
by her step she must be young perhaps she is pretty				5029.462648381708
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to watch valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred yes said valentine besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m noirtier s room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant				1974.1505548833156
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression				2898.954701045555
so beautiful				4120.577442882244
some straw they said				200.03387147720662
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever				5571.72327973672
scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean yes indeed my dear duke				255.69330299886735
how exquisitely coselli sings his part but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is well then what do you say to la specchia				48447.713961049056
she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war				2647.9480504700705
what is his name said he				5.445823661541899
valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking				3338.6514868650206
do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel dear good renée whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker				10074.031136116735
the child was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention				717.9122528569123
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career				4182.191297250434
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends				526.0624647802103
the signatures were perfectly legal				49840.0945412203

but to return to our subject well then you wish to know if i am of mazarin s party				4642.429763385767
good said he our syndic is at his post he knocked and the door was opened				1569.078749345156
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but more he is one of our friends no madame replied raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle the young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor				7476.0675489857595
all answer then				257.48377954828635
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud d artagnan				1.2756057922369601
i am lord de winter brother in law of that woman the three friends uttered a cry of surprise				1480.521867236642

he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis				191.14261211508182
that would be too terrible calm yourself sir replied de guiche				818.2103579694353

i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis				2789.8390509873525
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual				19136.414114577798
the patron of la jeune amélie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category				34656.658926446245
one went to support d artagnan the other porthos				325.6011419955231
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères luchon and cauterets				46986.654995737976
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé				341.8454355841113
he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed				37194.715233465744
caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it				83.19398113240574
then there was the ring with the lion s head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand				204.23612698441227
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house				388.82338947121553
mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key bravo said aramis how did you manage it like everything else with money but it cost me dear how much asked athos				22.568727915697085
upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service				1007.845596773409
he should have been nothing said the king nothing				321.8406137461872
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself then replied d artagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes				592.1514084018115
unquestionably edmond s star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain too and laugh at us all unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair he added				4718.9654200743435
danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips				487.1870930158427
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws				24181.05274965854
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous so young said albert forgetting at the moment the count s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέ speak nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile				402.1496425597035
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly				39878.50132428184
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious				11369.86002007322
still as five o clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner				813.0877543588314
he is the evil genius of both of us				719.9272749467434
on reaching the door he bowed				769.4086658777684
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring				7708.904870459558
but stop				3052.8602850356187
do you wish me to lend you some what a bad calculator you are exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation				38629.79010664665
you see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another				897.1729881617252
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced				1712.2740527986766
he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little mme				125.8341477514861
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the place royale by the duc de guise				5360.348994143888
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he				7.2763267966347085
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be another s turn and so on provided a single one arrives that is all that is required bravo d artagnan your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent i am going to take the waters you will accompany me				97.81159208073518
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre				38192.92249080651
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips				477.23216057070886
let us go then				246.47153109387983
the devil murmured d artagnan all this is vague enough				1775.3779487085292
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief				2614.4455201348965
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude				2094.0032489108726
grimaud is it thou grimaud signified that he was not mistaken				3234.861305818749
to present our respects to the cardinal porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed d artagnan				297.3165856003076
the devil said d artagnan to himself				189.52928529517897
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly				7305.385340689686
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn				15500.15567925322
meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him				61.94340712923969
no one has brought a letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter i left it where i found it monsieur				853.8958792790977
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place				771.8913218109542
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker				4654.811879969192
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birth in short two knights of the garter i said to myself my fortune is made				4913.456630637884
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one another s arms				484.86814658848897
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance				6298.831092224589
are you mad emmanuel				1292.460216874381
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time				436.81373742478746
should dantès not return mercédès might one day be his				1052.8842658371032
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable				4385.829908368206
the young men first approached the dead man				146.16211982289212
oh sir exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him				57.84951764997989
shall we go forward				948.8012417543445
very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion				30423.98640580251
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him				43.801407298126364
has not m danglars informed you of the ceremony oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety well said monte cristo you are fortunate m cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone				1008.120525012877
the thin spare man yes the executioner in short asked aramis				12.315422477152067
and i also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the place				671.0415275950191
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure				1966.437193121217
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability				50443.225964503574
you have seen the count you say i have only just left him and has he conformed to all that the letter specified he has do you understand it not in the least there is a dupe somewhere at all events it is neither you nor i certainly not well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does no i agree with you there				468.6170898770139
i will tell you all replied anne				1321.384358720345
with all my heart				265.30311766448125
the moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained				64684.39596342838
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper				3518.629328639867
and i no				327.9877891187079
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed				671.0008916785009
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back				1171.1668565737793
he therefore informed m morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleon s return				1847.4192299833433
see what she writes to me athos said he				7.778110172533493
grimaud bowed but stepped back				973.6287615709664
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house				385.85991021179296
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure				8522.383026715881
be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion				28901.93034375549
in this place were together pouches and barrels the pouches contained of money in gold and the barrels were filled with pounds of gunpowder				34698.12988076849
when you can find out a woman s age by her face it is useless to ask it when you can not do so it is indiscreet is she beautiful sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in france this reply reassured the vicomte				5260.682510941169
it is for you replied a gendarme				3826.917727108078
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was				1314.3593768759042
the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair				1318.064836062534
you only know that this money exists				24746.96017268311
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son				999.2055241467815
he that man what man that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted				62217.58903280359
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house				389.35809527367473
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count				476.94278943804846
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements my father i will know who my father is said the obstinate youth i will perish if i must but i will know it				59.203281023190776
the monk s eyes glittered				51334.28639185318
how go then exclaimed d artagnan				1.1507880755102982
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				1863.355551048931
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there				413.31853185648134
the ball fired by porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning				36412.11895893852
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen				3251.9416333523636
come calm yourself and reckon them up m				371.6804774253975
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering				241941.6717045773
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this				656.5961424051469
mouston cried porthos				159.59197341191012
baron send for the minister of war				2439.0434895307567
after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement				3208.5948256870834
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke d anjou his brother				1933.7794961653785
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell				3653.8476192915114
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o clock struck				1765.833267194808
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him				51.11770460963535
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering				2869.9570551400516
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy				39071.72933170722
don t you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage				2853.025453912619
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself				185.4510040555399
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl				43393.225970084786
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me				55.223378904662695
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor				33957.633650968644
not another step he said or you are a dead man what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other who are you inquired the sentinel				3908.6393314271195
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped				2275.1552303184894
as to the key it had disappeared				598.6585889663804
well said she you see he refuses yes but why need this annoy you you know albert women are singular creatures				3853.9764292312825
is it to make me a captain				1899.2427790985548
we shall not interfere with each other your object is a title mine money				719.2917860723597
danglars fancied that they had reached the long desired point he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows				22334.639233018144
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation				2123.9942124687714
this evening sir he replied all will be ready chapter xlvi				4472.74639086256
good evening m beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m de morcerf as you saw and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together				924.8078896269515
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here dantès whirled the stool round his head				343.88792978554034
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust				9062.050867852027
did you come to noisy to defend him i am waiting for no one replied d artagnan who was beginning to be angry				4570.708374205832
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache				22672.66754929934
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by d artagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d artagnan that he should marry her				169.60560658179037
the decanter and the glass were completely empty				2041.809223358725
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dantès				316.0150240045466
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother i demand justice upon you and i swear that if it be not granted to me i will execute it myself and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d artagnan leaving the place free for another accuser				12907.265570216103
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing				12131.684916741426
but his temper cooled down like his friend s he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos				24.776606020265987
here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death				844.3139777345784
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone				784.8899808787182
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion i suffer from emotion said monte cristo				58.43959407817256
why my companion				1699.0705530544897
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title				6793.333822727256
since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of d artagnan at no				416.7684470035172
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could				7936.359119566258
and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply				1099.4018244184542

do not lie my angel said d artagnan smiling that would be useless what do you mean				2038.6435513747508
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de or desdemona				25158.516248749267
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how				2078.378417595797
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility				25253.009865360797
that you inherit from your mother truly from my mother leonora corsinari how much may it amount to indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up				1233.3170843675348
his interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to two and twenty years				1171.0674556463966

this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim				37783.90583147568
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto				5436.776766115401
he thought of his wife				1142.0833342382346

villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate				12145.124749974126
the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly				6555.578413726895

do you intend opening the door said the baroness				921.2656614752196
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury				26631.49597448221
at the end of the second day m de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the abbé busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good m de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant				8639.568296763993
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body				1173.7654380890979
but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope milady answered by a glance which said is that all speak then and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she tenderly				3590.276907482576
d artagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently				43882.04346892475
accept this half pistole to drink to my health i do not drink bazin pushed away with dignity the officer s hand tis good only for the laity incorruptible murmured d artagnan i am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him				43.820543179874996
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival				5080.199696932753
i was not rich my life was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret the president frowned imperceptibly				5800.9015456021
a gendarme was crossing the court				1316.1831875848427

it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration				12082.797673475972
my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned				70766.22699281163
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats chapter lxxvi				30413.194898459304
from congo if you will it must be farther off than even that but what do i know of your parisian husbands oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray				911.5726017164995
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence				1906.4725610483895
unfortunately edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular				9523.485546162457
a great man in every country m debray said château renaud				255.20826199550078
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course oh yes yes i do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients				44410.87211394905
on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge				8223.313805302298
don t you agree with me aramis entirely my dear count				106.00618568915664
ten minutes afterward she was at home				1527.2492002162332
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel				28540.596582382383
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key				6793.171858958284
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him				70.65495269160873
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others				1431.4514467764368
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother				828.4866120648371
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word				743.4049108697097
it is then the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery asked d artagnan				1.7980825088626697
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance				1666.2075537229632
i tell you that you know these things as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken				1327.1767888044203
a poet is as good as an abbé				941.7709647909378
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell				2516.515039184411
you look like four conspirators oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning				605.0826076223099
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years				1269.359715034223
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal				220.43443834551857
m noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab horse				805.2613456782067
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken				3740.2321539506756
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she				80.89316623610256
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur				632.503385766512
the visitor was about fifty two years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe				6342.605575979472
the son whom you had by the marchesa corsinari and who was taken from you at five years of age				4132.682912895315
i had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he refused now we are getting on				1020.3692643688828
but that is all				414.8285945995687
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set				68683.17091382635
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening				721.3065528480657
imitate me				61.197811158361375
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage				1008.5898065070264
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop				39484.93283273512
on the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the swiss guard germain whither d artagnan had sent for her				131.60526101264048
yes yes very sure perhaps you did not see well oh if i were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak i should know him milady was dressing herself all the time				446.7338677794712
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place				674.2357622885936
he no longer loved her he adored her				119.67948592216877
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good will				1037.3549110794925
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal				8484.762473084029
i am free then sir cried dantès joyfully				4905.941614508176
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme				226.44984794633382
and now you are assembled gentlemen said d artagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis				506.2558622876461
once in london we shall be hard to find without considering continued athos throwing a glance at aramis the chances that may come to us on the way yes said aramis i understand i however do not understand said porthos				25.646844135951767
yes the gascon answered athos				12.220052161564192
this cost me on your account and mine francs				1029.8310117754108
now this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers restoring it to the title which belongs to it and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits we will publish the second immediately				1747.930776608858
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs				3234.6854653618498
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening				13360.363886267947
tis more than possible answered the comte de la fere				3570.1323004779715
and i keep my word				653.3926244919534
it must be nearly four o clock				1125.4385045069548
d artagnan came the next day to milady s and finding her in a very ill humor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m de wardes that provoked her thus				1159.6338245031718
i have said what i have said and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d artagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air				2130.518537973049
the whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation				12160.202926114951
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect				2736.2922586301884
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room				188.62247379501076
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps				3620.5172346896043
bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double locked				8083.9110318217145
all the world was ignorant of it				107.71626346166104
yes madame are you ready i am and his eminence the cardinal has got off without any accident				3551.8650790767892
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres				6059.1964188803
upon that athos yielded				13506.782254290627
planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from him				60.55594207825075
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you				74.15879040665207
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling				147.1576806225837
they went out				203.86755657725254
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution ah said athos how much time we have lost now said the king give the word and let us start will you not give it sire asked athos				52.0697800737045
you may retire said milady				41.61018284732933
my profession condemns me to celibacy				114830.31373228002
i could never agree to it still you have thought of it incessantly alas cried the abbé				887.808346519891
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around				2423.4046138703075
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him the servant bowed and retired				1362.6309372863818
happily i vanquished death				835.9613518755609
the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes				6948.115415328806
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud i have brought you another said d artagnan				1.4874899575716616
now to the work i have in hand and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed				3322.392381258399
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon				34982.34556062529
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner rapid as had been villefort s glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate				40382.1829836012
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude				68739.52520385226
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on				663.7596003899756
d artagnan ran after her				119.08495327761172
they shook their heads				3557.1260960605923
i am quite resigned				8727.140101154844
this was the room appropriated to the sailors				5844.910095259323
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect				49316.174296143574
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron				15640.119907441678
a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated				35463.59983234897
p s be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear				8220.867351977398
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do that is it replied the cardinal dryly				13815.68471374335
and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them				120.87476166146897
d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens				36129.929092436425
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder				1245.8086442894876
oh dear yes sir the abbé s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte s emissaries one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in a very resolute and very dangerous man indeed said the englishman				1365.3776090102626
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said				227.35089078579335
tis he past all doubt what do you say nothing nothing				240.62234794924487
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it				66.05192212414707
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun				2656.9355885865602
a man was hidden in lafitte s banking house behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk he saw mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw albert withdraw				6390.205738326105
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures				12238.874376231824
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				5311.213842007995
a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure				3896.4988950820475
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir				45099.18667782939
as for me i play my game squarely fairly and above board as i always do				1144.947639597171
good luck to you the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at la canebière				14027.603537467412
it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map yes sir replied the count i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individuals a physiological study				2572.3736787444645
there came in moreover two drafts which m morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted				4225.416599776791
besides this time my visit has a motive milady trembled she thought felton had told all				433.59881311014533
the young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new comer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m emmanuel and that his business was with m morrel in person				910.0078241848366
during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune then with that money he speculated in the funds and trebled or quadrupled his capital and having first married his banker s daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a madame de nargonne daughter of m de servieux the king s chamberlain who is in high favor at court				1360.8193315636236
explain to me why going out of this chamber isn t everything because having neither arms nor password we shouldn t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms yes but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun				4141.2876889806475
d artagnan seemed iron				24756.520237626868
it was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home				1761.2653605684927
ha ha ha she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless				3034.7816134441173
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done				569.5403086084066
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices				29829.672419633476
as for aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character a character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its development his lackey was called bazin				2540.854542038158
many might take for their device the epithet strong which formed the second part of his motto but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the faithful which constituted the first				1704.2815033878292
keep that ring for love of me				89.7893244951844
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea i think i can assist your researches said maximilian				2309.5868452463865
the bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom				3779.145440400402
valentine had not seen him				41.93777538220921
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls fêtes or carousals as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna estafania the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu				3332.0957362086097
only one minute mr felton and you will have saved my honor to kill yourself cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground i have told my secret				1298.2787555609502
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all				333.79398350572063
well said andrea admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you that i may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements eh dear friend said caderousse are wills ever made without codicils				48685.828576435066
then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned				4255.877353880399
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady he almost believed in the crime of de wardes				2335.8879697510088
their number was great				6350.01360559019
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion				6322.850844631278
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind				611.8392434918956
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream the jeweller smiled				659.6860688496802
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette				78120.99323418702
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite				12483.788064904818
the religion i serve the god i adore were blasphemed because i called upon that religion and that god but still i resisted				6097.239645808413
ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind				619.0207122261377
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man				205.20537888361596
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door				228.8446707908586
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly				2128.123352702545
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are no it is not worth while well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece all right he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs				5851.9433147743875
and athos i have not yet seen him				42.29500358726374
it was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again				686.6836480659965
at the noise made by d artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world				607.0367683410137
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter				709.5564419524275
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside				64459.44232909583
the countess took albert to meet madame danglars				157.86886453333042
every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty soubrette				10711.096811518335
i thought he was up to something it s a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said aramis				17.922136673391375
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so no replied the count i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in me i your excellency yes you				75.97213372076898
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the count oh he is so dreadfully pale i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out				282.1072321001382
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit				7337.83963978969
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio don t you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands true and he is going to land them added franz				530.047878130829
where are you going cried the two musketeers in a breath				3230.2617527220186
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best				2458.214170242628
the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands wait wait said the duke				295.95812413581973
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert				47744.842400238456
come let us see them here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table francs in gold and francs in bank notes				6615.96044014096
this affair made a great noise				3381.3875174180666
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments				5039.886570608305
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz				24748.84828793414
you said anne de bueil did you not yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for i am dying i absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end i absolve you				132.64371541562627
aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly				4820.968192868375
you can not think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger				74040.96007054532
this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place				673.0023293217998
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table				542.2844462213261
who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m de richelieu who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine my friends monsieur the queen shook her head				337.0172658117905
they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered				464.190942859577
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time				446.1965304636452
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door				215.67273235637154
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet				376.1781261019341
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or danish				30801.761178206834
as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre				4492.595220652189
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass				1508.1842001641069
what am i to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant				45023.080369369265
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup together				990.166315827906
did not you know that my dear lord something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me				61.088070916221795
there are moments when a man grows young again in his children the duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically				54414.94665428696
peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto				37769.78332352021
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids				10640.39891053182
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo pardieu everyone exists doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses have you seen the greek mistress i have both seen and heard her				149.8373798166529
my friend				479.785842915511
our family although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence				3548.905792681423
then believe me it will be time to act yes we will wait				1486.462471728337
this cursed rolling said blaisois				172.8056098497831
now attach him to our party				4425.32782698664
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination				5650.95464140983
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room				202.96432870172092
now my wife came home four days ago monsieur				652.941327251512
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject				1374.1566469360546
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus				4928.756231279895
it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him				49.86134074193722
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house				384.1139212327205
to be imprisoned				31780.33234278276
what are you about asked d artagnan				1.26725863654871
those must have been ten weary years dantès took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him				44.661521749966376
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist				57786.140486861244
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look				1438.871025072734
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard				12464.361566437425
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves				2063.8058404192234
la jeune amélie was first at the rendezvous				5323.257250424252
he was struck by a sudden idea				2134.8283194839246
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept				6087.5483015422615
or rather to observe the chronological order i and d artagnan replied athos				14.631120016888104
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count				198.20368152730734
by this smile m de tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the point				2284.568613963491
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the count s manner				834.7094356333666
then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me oh the voice of nature said monte cristo				179.92775829971302
i believe so replied aramis				10.524793695512782
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied d artagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come said d artagnan aloud i have no motive for defending monsieur				631.2827789241729
porthos had discovered the means the diamond				2263.1373370708475
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother				782.7252304141896
stop cried d artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men				377.1195897083655
chapter vii				754.5208388069565
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference				48966.657299750135
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès				334.95264460508093
arrived at the staircase it was still worse				7490.012037057484
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and re entered the house				395.6838824595462
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything				883.6048261707441
what cried d artagnan				1.1426805212518292
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped				54622.08615401385
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting				10937.092947236915
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house				382.0669065367709
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic				72446.05784417009
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed				8347.842935293844
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures				3534.941812926887
but by what means				2704.996434345273
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance				3645.129162954612
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape				1962.4776524132492
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute				30571.009180283538
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey				10430.655032495528
well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man				96.09581476161172
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him				132.5416068716751
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors				45133.04820313504
and i idem said aramis				11.715767600048759
the englishman was an original i had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service				1052.937484942236
the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld				24754.725968680206
chapter ii				6650.094099659434
do not fancy that i do you a favor i use either hand easily				28391.82864370192
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility				22606.98770602534
the facchino follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting				44144.04508932381
where the devil shall i say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him thought d artagnan				2.0171189469307973
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived				1967.711900064381
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs				2367.1784616420214
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered				12564.900473205169
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive				8593.206811002257
alas poor albert				234.46210771823795
come he said tis a warning from heaven				971.5260697846478
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend				12839.888451758135
did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty louis and who was the winner nautilus				41126.923485877945
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos				153.67926926240227
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked				9081.101087351339
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance				8525.846078272865
now i am going to show you how sincere i am good thought d artagnan we must look about us he s going to play us a trick i offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it				62.83995797101003
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women				1428.939069049294
shall i see you again asked the countess				2033.1546947399593
and my only heir are you not said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady				1331.1100554718894
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis				14.735372172135618
let us know when breakfast is ready				1226.9445794317783
you are therefore your own master till seven o clock in the evening but at seven o clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses there said planchet				189.17922662452844
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her				145.17703240173188
they would have found they have not found but they are on the track yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it				86.40577121613393
indeed said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy				4581.077023116432
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him				57.89135132482198
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos				277.51725249774626
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la fere i can see nothing remarkable about it my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens				2232.5034297452494
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall				945.0003726269155
do you know what he has done this child				1227.777977484648
i can not explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them				98.20827633916005
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husband s inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door				229.44289232724682
let us dispense with useless words				840.6999426089751
for women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me				111.94044999108698
i may continue to rely upon it may i not oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to me				98.674912069693
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting pistols then at eight o clock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being				7882.750234852095
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain				2753.5117124864946
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light				2495.210306706493
what was the matter with you baron d artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal				2232.528978865629
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas				4260.441802148716
a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity				41829.35342787367

athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man				329.312949984365
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared				540.4789404431484
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another step long live the emperor said the figure				204586.9446928026
you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do yes i insist on it said albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings				5798.921366501017
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur d artagnan to the end of the world				946.756231607439
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock				2047.2277276137677
well said he they likewise have refused me that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself he took a quill wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission and returned it to him				50.48235883423418

sir he thus addressed d artagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt				36177.889450504634

he took to his heels and was soon at m de tréville s but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de tréville s office				4437.465204570134
the moon lighted the group				10966.797339568766
as soon as she was gone noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary				5002.898255385516
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta				4514.417454738054
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily				80157.67471871982
i who am going to give you another piece of good advice what is it to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger				2110.879616977421
danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested				3045.4044863700287
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans				62715.495331776176
give him a lesson debray stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived what is it it is she whom do you mean they said she had left mademoiselle eugénie said château renaud has she returned no but her mother madame danglars				195.2145772988155
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case				1495.2476879468584
so sir you lived at lucca did you				67.02778346828411
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another				976.3019332034958
take your glass then and let us drink				3231.6791477255924
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine a name				796.4739138965128
it is pleasant to have such well dressed brethren and those gendarmes behaved shamefully				68925.75689667935
you have read the letter yes you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class				18672.807653766806
fernand dashed his on the ground				1369.3489968846293
if it were so with m morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it how so he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months				2747.0502694391284
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo				185.7499610670186
what has the count done				580.0702205391469
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney and this king s attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly				9617.851946407594
advise me what i had better do emmanuel returned my sister the house of morrel can only be carried on by a morrel				1028.0245089370628
if there is any left murmured he				18.549911024577234
did i know poor dear edmond				844.2238000884487
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders				2398.8995455353784
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features				4633.910482813273
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation				87148.76962805561

what man is that				653.9645907435406
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows				7141.0307229369155
franz questioned albert as to his intentions but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor				32424.300525879407
come to our house tomorrow				1184.5552756204736
good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door				269.97221698544735
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal then i must wait here or in the neighborhood only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here why you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute that s true but is this little woman then to escape his eminence bah said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am her best friend ah that s true				1537.398153685813
but there is nothing which would do nothing oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help				2295.293473964444
besides the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer				1503.2681530806187
then you must have something on your mind said athos				10.544012433566062
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine no				385.47022734130525
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent				57354.82069698199
in fact of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil				23398.689490663684
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are shed you who weep d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased				3850.629558993084
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room				186.38229100971958
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athos s closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords				2278.5979823665666
edmond s hair stood on end and he rose to his knees				2360.0115566455115
these protestations were nothing for mme				143.49901112679905
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said d artagnan				1.2248184690691801
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct				6180.111820914236
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance				1974.9433293235647
major bartolomeo cavalcanti				1261.060760248249
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune				3759.313981027926
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop				3736.4566466117735
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts				1388.6705147148296
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood				3881.581806465166
have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thing i mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to				2079.1694244321893
what is it				78.09286630572865
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have called him in my long sleepless nights how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them				103.18758228733546
and no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs				1824.9569487738488
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance				4300.413768207295
stop there madame for this can not last				2292.0932549551935
now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are				2697.7906683511433
the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them				99.95304896045609
good morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m de boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest				3497.4788818698457
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union				6346.756396712918
it is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere				9856.59594044056
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call				4944.782487976683
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission				7357.558203208978
give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it the steward bowed and was about to quit the room				198.27079561252398
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you				134.4284984721723
oh my god				329.6225989443206
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos				442.44161899564705
what can have happened then to bragelonne let him enter cried d artagnan let him come up but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it				87.6254164802386
friends are shadows				19930.438863844403
yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife				1255.4389543182272
gone never to return oh madame do not think that i tell you he will never return				1577.1018862306607
they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious				44625.57110604132
we are ready ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said did i not answer for them but you sir said the queen to aramis				25.16676279096235
you may retire we consent to that				508.2935191903914
and what favor pray asked lord de winter				376.2629803809414
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him				52.585528986086345
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others				1482.8434959481426
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before in short if i go will you go too i will try you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many things what are they mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded				21564.786011610715
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty				3241.819292542809
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock				4046.195983748011
what are your grandmother s symptoms an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched				7381.5945428284585
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king				614.8275955439246
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself				1850.8006418352606
i am going to prove to you that i have not good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning monsieur d artagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain yes my lord and your friend still longs to be made a baron at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already then said mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown d artagnan take this dispatch and carry it to england d artagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it				78.55882698993948
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i love him and will be only his were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts				1369.258891854448
here was the officer d artagnan was seeking				5437.953869083879
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming				34353.394044307126
do not go away exclaimed d artagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you athos of such a man as you aramis and he threw himself into the arms of athos				677.3415168759891
let us return to the object that brings me here what that which brings you home to me				69.77411527591495
i often think of that young man d artagnan strange				8153.057899998484
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought				2322.003082217193
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem				32209.548803150945
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane insane raving mad his head becomes weaker				12125.508282482948
desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire				3694.8173250292684
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river				2361.1788240455426
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors				56300.53948238836
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound ah he ll come round thought d artagnan that s not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to d artagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics				65888.06930865467
for example an english prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of malmsey				36957.21370592463
he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrna that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life and your precautions were successful completely so yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited i really did not remember i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south and that is the case observed monte cristo				230.0962140333134
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				381.4467105945026
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis				660.6808366662234
one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the island of elba the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo				41540.38429420272
when in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held secret				1381.0922090650517
villefort s conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage				5941.553296233225
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance				3949.918684996537
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror				3510.34733796607
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered				384.5152506865542
why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered can i believe my ears cried the marquise				2086.405511385876
i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon thank you my good friend				532.4452766388192
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator s wife				1356.4146775741756
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much				1590.1929522684736
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter i can my lord said raoul				173.21306372983184
it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression				3072.616880588876
oh cried porthos as if in pain				2948.5913100381185
and by whom were they recommended to you oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement would you not trust the cavalcanti i				1018.7051622406848
the miser in molière s comedy of l avare ed				7019.6804009633415
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side				923.636059496786
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall				895.8716931074034
their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one				742.4282431280321
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there				420.8527702579961
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				2594.104691539295
man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours				2760.1133827508015
the musketeer was introduced to m coquenard whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new				33734.399282348975
what you tell me is horrible sir				265.5282680061061
what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence and shall we go and find him inquired franz				502.50971978655724
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye not on your own account surely replied monte cristo for a man is above that sort of thing oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head				346.92601952725914
you see said lord de winter presenting d artagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman				2297.335589328173

he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing i doubt it planchet replied d artagnan but what are you thinking of i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested always cautious planchet tis instinct your honor well what does your instinct tell you now sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in ah ah said d artagnan planchet s recital agreeing with his own observations				141496.08293334744

ah very well replied the cardinal quickly				1604.2140281954782
as to d artagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate				12484.597662983022
he is pursued but where is he				486.18640612009244

the order is positive				12265.23452960519
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone and d artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy				12491.386064765178
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up				1119.3794486225856
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the count s stopped before the hôtel de londres				10483.529966028647
i should be delighted to do so was the reply but if i am not mistaken the words in haste are written on the envelope of the letter which i brought you are right said du tremblay				28927.989146464788
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death				926.0434660243649
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children				8038.829176913067

on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start				6820.436013689002
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenances nothing was omitted go on go on said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come				1633.8975953227512
why really the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police				6715.156031642517
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham				2702.4733893592506
a little better sir will you drink some of this ether and water i will try but don t touch me why not because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return drink barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him				52.8565053354015
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling				1162.6391600064771
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters				3435.3179993836925
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers				1958.9174268409238
as to porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair				1131.1106607795996
ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice				603.1824806995565
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful				5271.44991552383
sure enough said the general				3083.2192872107935
i enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make				2791.095135854692
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight				3119.539500224068
he became curious to solve the problem				5832.37060073562
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step				1348.503677595367
well cried his auditors at the moment you left his house aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat				2776.529333299857
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly i shall go he said to the queen well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris to whom zounds				3125.2448584919625

madame de villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared				569.0128769579325
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses				5584.107104307559
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard				18715.23829835737
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance fernand smiled piteously				22204.281911579863
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts				1644.5591956712187
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier				3295.61945012207
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m noirtier				635.4399348088091
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh				41772.06848882664
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead go sir count replied d artagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england				1261.4113789081405
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth				11325.98678230667
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above				4777.241908407189
oh thank me again said the count tell me till you are weary that i have restored you to happiness you do not know how much i require this assurance oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said valentine and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée				1498.3988530977947
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album				54930.18857711938
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide				12847.409127542742
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god				485.9096778016755
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable				36473.66943337166
you understand dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience				7858.498328520424
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey				1865.5817267945195

porthos looked at d artagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companion s gascon sharpness continually supplied him				49.06065287096375
edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there				620.5504098519923
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain				1525.72791762723
one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti				1644.172636951103

as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail				6396.174721767037
no my daughter is not guilty				2005.8509462622462
now is that all i believe so let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth d artagnan and athos to the bastille aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse porthos an ass madame bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion armentières on the banks of the lys				42552.910451800686

m noirtier again closed his eyes				594.9516766078971
true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia				41406.184454516195
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying great god exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand				210.54903486233903
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation				2620.2826777739747
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame				903.6837399920287

you see it is not my fault and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls one fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar				52580.419032938145
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north				46124.278280809616

well said the baroness				954.9323051786622
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain				6390.035103701836
go the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him				42.688726126337876
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him				47.21337401905322
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual				4721.549331651651

his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived				59059.14901655666
the audience m de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent				6280.338607061297
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage				1188.9975783597095

there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment				642.1089024645615
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d artagnan s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose				7759.6366472192485
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme				161.67628326193795
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving				13586.66119270596
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				12593.89636145048

perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress				6837.342549333458
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated				17063.184994417625

he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color				5046.312027372522
where he was no one knew				3987.821481690988
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp				216.55319624882688
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida				34532.70788568917
what is he doing				3828.0127736924815
that is my failing a capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good drinker athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction				6835.191090562742

the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage				1982.2117314958086
his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbé faria had been				2996.034731321361

if you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the other s shoulder				1239.0885495716916
monsieur d artagnan murmured raoul				161.73688992066988

what a noise about a musketeer				1280.9519498925208

i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods nor yet his wife that is a child s reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner				949.1496719556696
valentine repeated the same voice				299.47834251792295
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm				4838.8446705511915
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief				2602.221963093224
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage i do not think that is the case however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed				3989.746306034792

and you i shared the same fate at aquapendente do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention				803.4046494005555

half past one only said he				6.640821551306819
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal				44670.57786829484
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last				2232.668439634718

we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes				56132.19759272067
but you d artagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally				14745.115358342331

in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life				582.7374934394763
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together impossible said d artagnan we are under mazarin s orders i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like d artagnan and porthos				333.84539788096896
we will send my brother s servant back to béthune whom as i told you we can trust				16767.881755122748
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined				40019.04514032616

monsieur bazin the beadle said the verger				77243.40918826492
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric				50394.99830564464
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf				1947.4553126655721
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again				431.75311318152075
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance				2876.599228061786
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated they continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service				998.6615568639774
d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive				32197.694061355905

after which the cardinal who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke				35360.967448379044
submit this honour to somebody else and he sat down				643.5262471595227
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				16296.376212439509
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right				1358.2806523350778

why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence				9748.082687484828

how did your father receive him albert				149.85531434551513
in your case it would be a crime				3671.5677271176964
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty				34396.306215648605
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood				10287.02712415568
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom what influence can i possibly have over a bandit have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten what is that have you not saved peppino s life well well said the count who told you that no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant				1830.2153407214641
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown				33440.09761583252
they fell into the line of carriages				7095.771038571498
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels				13240.308850699514
that man is cromwell said he				5.445850278510504
i was there				425.9671783004604
i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs				29755.232241242837
i have but one portmanteau i dare say you have nothing else with you				125.50983342634058
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow				1073.2379895977188
then on the anniversary of the day on which i had been insulted i hung my cassock on a peg assumed the costume of a cavalier and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which i knew my man was invited				3427.1961502440927
did you fancy yourself dying no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès				628.1365671910071
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and m d épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart				4329.655825930971
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london why so because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice ah				281.19089895927925
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards				28050.565427856316
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively				7905.689603260033
let us go immediately they sent for a cabriolet				32787.147153075086
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three steps forward				1482.9566322444819
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head				361.17197465121114
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant				2374.6875615543995
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview				3999.529311525798
besides what was morcerf seeking				6763.7973683325845
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah				335.14372165441375
yes his mother but does he know this secret then i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mother s as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges thus speaking he fell back exhausted				5554.321871379467
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land				3104.0632631599065
what do you say to a thousand crowns d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner				813.4433625861973
i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea but it is very hard for me my poor caderousse you take advantage bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores one would have said andrea anticipated his companion s words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment				780.5738944946075
all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished				46858.092168659045
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself				2042.41002941875
fatality he muttered				4842.403898642698
this evening with you to morrow at stuart s the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said d artagnan				28.991411361079276
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little progress				82067.01140153344
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror				3127.50785092133
back shouted d artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell				3115.1128321699794
d artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator s wife and d artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress possible				989.1984134688478
while d artagnan was examining mme				115.81102880547587
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner				814.4738361964769
the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty				1721.8715808540617
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor				4644.085893613284
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf				1654.698493568842
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				1994.0048655717496
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry				28598.358033399127
go but to portsmouth or southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement				5498.18370070072
what more need be said				218.39926587946164
they who love believe easily in love				863.6252324936382
would you like a proof of it				68.25615104713738
that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains				48813.726373933794
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours				1848.6925953322252
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result				5398.183088682303
this was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house to marry her and to wait respectfully m de villefort s pardon no said noirtier				384.5200178462502
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said d artagnan if you persist in offering him a civility				3447.5697545489625
m coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things				2552.2542941560027
this evening said the governor				830.1957926143866
now said he that suffices begone which way the way you came you wish me to get out at that window you got in very well oh you have some design against me reverend sir idiot				30340.191863413234
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up				958.2452253951869
for us also inquired athos				10.576680639552656
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile				413.3374525104171
the letter is here and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom				1656.981918478883
they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and m de tréville s note in the other				606.2626735529468
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young				3887.4201743168096
take a cigar really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand how happy you are to have nothing to do				1191.6618608586248
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars				108.46733317322267
aramis was astonished				2187.466504148109
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade				4697.095022536495
and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant				1441.6462570863416
yes but the contract the same smile returned				1027.3766683736644
the abbé s chamber chapter				226.33865616103267
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also				1381.2884727220942
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women				1372.5332444721564
give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas				1475.6798034959186
the world is not wanting in attractions				68919.05248491242
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis				10.683418588915707
when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii				845.053878455506
my vocation commands me it carries me away d artagnan smiled but made no answer				792.2025351060831
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals				28016.825842341284
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also				1562.0331503059974
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa				4445.368954115155
his plan is very simple				6851.768267500965
yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation lord de winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct				5186.032790361342
planchet met them hard by the shed				6924.097149846712
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil the terror of all expert palates				24690.265914652024
i guess what brings you here how and why because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject by whom by a banker of paris my correspondent whose name is danglars he cried albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred				3916.3891649504244
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately				1651.7084389432598
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god				764.2755665925969
let us manage it better				1273.989434126022
i left it when i was but five years old replied haydée				1460.712001199262
thanks monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you				194.50293524545623
and on what floor does he live asked comminges				403.83566837063427
there was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation which looked like shame				3858.5992254983234
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress				6369.28827449032
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest				40975.337147859806
there was a great press of people in m de villefort s antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name				785.355704291965
the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity				31993.900440157846
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you				122.92699856055874
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening				737.4449016031492
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend				4500.837528746595
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs				1122.7755782288934
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance				45316.39211152009
hang it cried d artagnan another twenty pistoles lost				856.0215012248298
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued				2705.9317320446203
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès				804.6134506974021
oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed				1854.1581821172103
there said he demand thy child of carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions				1651.6351941432104
is your love returned i suppose so said andrea with a triumphant smile since i am accepted				4430.310609470813
oh nothing but a scratch said d artagnan				1.168197035154218
let us go and die with them said the king				285.50721810227975
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them				110.88791713308018

god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that god i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him oh said caderousse groaning with pain				2809.5395038834968
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities				5439.7692849758
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked				8005.472960228564
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris				502.2998606109634
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him				41.89943773106544

for the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones				3755.297162843088
dead repeated a third voice				325.25199719755125
now i belong to this last named class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain				11120.52071724757
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you i am called the count de guiche continued the young man my father is the marechal de grammont and now that you know who i am do me the honor to inform me who you are i am the viscount de bragelonne answered raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the count de guiche had done				577.347978784118

didn t you see that monsieur d artagnan mounted with difficulty				4142.966541061741
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m de tréville				1960.4919918975547
besides what is required of a young man in paris				538.5993108953726
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts				1321.2646479623918
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château d if dantès nevertheless determined to make for them				108.75082514794563

the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box				2078.576636659132

aramis saluted then turning toward athos i don t care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said				289.5498082806607

m de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news				2959.946869297084
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them				126.47262755569014
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh				1467.6812543314368

still the same story of superfluities				36675.17117636145

all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me				70.62113511676186
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease is that all he will know what that means he will guess at least				1806.3051717162434

let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all i want oh muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him				66.23535716443635

i pardon you and i weep for you				81.2657871147014
well then to my health				4236.844053582153
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear				9619.796670248708
when d artagnan had finished he said hum				51009.125478956346
in three seconds d artagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos and one for aramis at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log				28962.245973532266
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow				2207.012742133183
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her				122.69574114276543
can it be otherwise				5126.625628543025
as to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous enough				1834.5867444481562
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before				689.4725044013034
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them and i too said porthos				16.466471362389992
how was he going to find athos				37.173470220097634
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso				7132.203331213299
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees				2233.7013591912464
i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you tréville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failed he who knows how bitterly i execrate him to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him				43.044909864718505
almost immediately bazin came downstairs				3029.934819993537
oh not the least in the world madame				1073.0814025375466
you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand				216.4984750401206
or s blood my brave athos will die at the cries of m de tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded man				298.4106602824951
speak speak take this letter said d artagnan				1.1680610209279185
do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant				3125.286585291075
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels				36737.8670226564
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels				4432.115083213528
from whom asked the gascon				355.6284781557558
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures me				54.97428340351047
d artagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends				547.0977117307427
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he won t object to a soft one take every care of him i beg of you charles bowed and retired				1550.094604614893
my dear mother said he do you know if m de morcerf has any enemy mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my father my son she said persons in the count s situation have many secret enemies				1483.2430470743059
i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that				667.2118073530388
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary				4387.047229397252
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz				354.8477565752895
go to your father go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me shall i row you ashore no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars				458.53734750860326
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love				1015.5937955780083
you have done this i hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees				2393.3124669346134
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender				179370.7066971049
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him				49.081969381990724
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs she was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force				3245.0330982577025
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris				518.0202349542412
look at the arms the sergeant put the lantern near the panel				18529.96856431395
eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we				5191.728515832873
her lips were cold it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue				4134.046804714478
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder				7572.320142829742
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale				828.4862170117297
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison				1317.771986532725
yes what is it have you confidence in me give your orders said the three musketeers				1237.1733350445775
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him				42.75309821616199
d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept				3871.935907036612
no accident has happened to him none sir and he lives still at the hotel of the great charlemagne and passes his time sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse				2247.4740017292042
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist				43660.71914980366
in crete he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring				8015.404113300873
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard				56796.682713548566
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail				11365.100876392758
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word				710.3194767760189
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes				4222.854505918789
i am lost				689.8566101705027
take notice captain he continued giving planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen and i said planchet with dignity i know them and i answer for them as he said this he pressed grimaud s hand who seemed honored by the distinction				20077.39002427306
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton				2405.519170195103
i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her				118.72327764907703
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn				823.887180501354
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur bonacieux				1679.237346400395
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion				2363.876889613579
pardieu said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house				387.1210262049884
what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures				7331.42536216485
your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine				11604.03279237143
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him				46.10292285110455
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o clock tomorrow morning my dear count replied danglars				129.66478771810878
i must die then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame				8325.454487854262
what am i				575.950593073875
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles				2825.1135697443865
then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees				1732.8361927333665
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard				1041.6300470708984
you hailed me i think danglars retreated a step or two				3661.958257764778
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable				9159.048333917726
if i only were a a baron don t you mean cried d artagnan finishing his friend s sentence				7718.711031017842
do you remember aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel a shudder at the recollection hold just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past				3308.84945766068
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden				2519.656113848527
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column				26576.28772263639
having accomplished these three social duties monte cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my duty now let others do theirs andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count				297.94927560321605
what is the matter said the count				102.0558030593031
the two serving men waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances				36498.40924524635
it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is yours ah bah				3614.838393614334
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead				42800.036863185014
from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going				1517.428428810994
all is well we may sleep tranquilly on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him				51.157548587389336
who is this caderousse some provençal it appears				6050.748368214697
that s true said he quietly for my part i have never loved acknowledge then you stony heart said d artagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts tender hearts				6195.667458751183
occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in darkness				973.0588142627076
i m your man i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner				3389.801647572407
and i too said d artagnan				1.072849275524344
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat				2060.7701606458354
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty anne hesitated				1561.9110020685953
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too malcontent i go away enchanted farewell then or rather au revoir for i hope we shall meet again whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminence s orders that will be frequently i assure you for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation oh				835.3269937273611
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age				3844.67044648677
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing				46041.699704581915
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom				7560.594249348609

these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long				1597.1446940961057

the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it				74.9916737310469
so d artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarin s nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists adieu then and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine				1635.40507568603
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea				800.4476449156584
they were making nearly ten knots an hour				1153.7289572941697
d artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge				7400.0261672999
yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt				2723.089971429511
how do you feel this morning he inquired				3460.370077779995
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes				636.1699811624444
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his				1068.641001617454

his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht				3117.083097445781
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living				2103.9729512296262
stand here don t stir turn your back to the road and wait for me having thus spoken d artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village				4831.1811442357275
the king s children next arrived the princess charlotte a beautiful fair haired child with tears in her eyes and the duke of gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride				3244.1790721553057

i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known good my son				964.9810457851405
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations				32875.09744698702
i thought you would never come in what s the matter now planchet demanded d artagnan				1.9893285878350548
nothing but saddles now do you understand said athos				9.890957637082476
the servant announced m albert de morcerf				778.1360338168329
oh exclaimed morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be listen said the count				104.06817717591107
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity				8799.53121233857
i wish to consult you about some thing do so do you think it is time for us to enter the service but are you not still in the service you d artagnan i mean active service				1014.6890928031908
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket grimaud immediately obeyed				910.3971386519735
milady was all attention				712.3756873128885

my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm				2528.4734431421834
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy				647.1314475031854
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world				792.1700491341018
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment how you are going soon asked milady				99.93355737812601
all at once felton stopped				2026.128411971026
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust				2339.845443900433
in a few minutes laporte came into the room				195.82729518545327
first my stranger of meung then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wounds next milady whose secret i have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance i have balked well said athos that only makes four and we are four one for one				717.1355904389698
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange				6156.740003487337
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future				1887.4340089599802
he was very taciturn this worthy signor				31032.331189918215
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent				2374.315051155445
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes				505.2376899436408
besides the appearance of the caravan was formidable				10034.21074190794
with one word you have crushed it and i die but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart				205.85249767057812
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee				1849.4826107756141
what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor				2652.388686851493
what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom				6722.28113689527
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme				4212.115485709868

nor you to mine cried the abbé				429.273895070246
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform				1951.8619450730837
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your plan well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs				1007.1864590757078
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				3617.400703558662
what is that news asked d artagnan				1.221647617037137
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance alas said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all that for me i well know my sweet girl said d artagnan				33.36675398973886

as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m de la trémouille in whose service he had a relative d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror				74619.82025654042
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place				671.882955655586
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste				2006.3062749244239
i as a philosopher should like a little country house a cottage down there under the trees without so many free stones over my poor body				1224.732151837378
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said				315.23317016377297

the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal				1963.5868677521016
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m de tréville the guards to that of m dessessart				6344.027198584578

but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it				68.20624209877496
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the parade he had already three inches of steel in his breast				933.6670631033437

coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal				29011.286301427004

and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as soot the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin				7628.625267073465
d artagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind				630.5216598343599
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head				351.8198044568981

for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars				472.8531458207468
i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living athos was for a few moments thoughtful				4447.226214164533

at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away				420.76006712315

at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people athos shuddered from head to foot				2559.1982444867326
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine				1285.7146813165082

at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats				26216.162619767158
it is a woman s voice cried aramis faith i would give a good deal if she is young and pretty and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her				207.86350484284745

the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way				612.4341142754084

the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter				703.0919168899018
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her means				1587.9462907756574

after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes				11066.374758531563

it was scarcely eleven o clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier				3826.330181278863
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than that he has made himself understood how was such a thing possible by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil good morning madame said the count bowing				2406.708945770401

he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold				2444.8352493696866

the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince				1030.5590224068733

he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance				1337.289416276059

coquenard was in the dilemma of harpagan				29274.25917564906
the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword but the name of m de tréville and that of m de la trémouille commanded a little reflection				3445.692898280317
i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me				78.44252566474387
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously				5577.512806202269

by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor tell me who this man was cried the young officer				1060.7065697864416
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled				8141.20132727876
didn t i say so cried planchet				129.5151861043635
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise				5226.592705648457
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed				5321.211752074488

i kiss your hands				770.540229455709

you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them				103.29972915346914
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissary for he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion				6280.931585418674
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain				32943.32769687197
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair players				29547.448392431514
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle				6421.122910004424
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year				3001.216528624933

count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort				53101.42836754239
as for you viscount continued monte cristo to morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination				2814.141093921846
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo				285.52423616576834

she renewed the order relative to the gascon but as before she expected him in vain				1382.5622294715092
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead				619.8879443632544

he determined to make two cardinals by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich men this was the return the holy father looked for				1049.6519910415211
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead chapter				227.02632825605713
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged				4428.012765629275

he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions				5345.0450250437925
yes i see for the young man raoul said d artagnan				1.2247815109114688
well my dear friend said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours				5457.353050949611
yes in landed property no in stock yes the stock is in your own hands the look which m noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find				8067.337376514436
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations certainly and that is why m and madame de saint méran have died that is why m noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward				3019.8036222799396
what horses asked athos				9.536594869896406
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever				2716.75432494981
he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated a few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony				35332.98856061896
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile				374.9347798535984
the tree was easy to climb				37972.97686723145
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale				863.4720532799658
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands				529.3578241982949

at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow				43194.79433656569
only we conspire against the rochellais ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence				1897.7490780599255
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine				41502.17244232224
i was then obliged to come back again				248.78644721673356
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited d artagnan s reply				1186.2996549013637
come aramis and we porthos said d artagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action d artagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort				1327.9883469551987
then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way				596.9790034950161
well monsieur he is still here ah pardieu my dear dame said d artagnan springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life where is this dear aramis				229.2883524502257
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them				115.17945981989948
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst				41975.53165373898
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love				773.8065353130108
besides are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud mousqueton and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos porthos and aramis yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you please				3398.713147786209
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos				137.4597656292081
at length the light disappeared				535.8863984592166
nothing replied bonacieux nothing				219.14242708648322
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty a zealous catholic no doubt shook off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame				883.9111902614437
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends				521.7498821902209
i will not sleep where i must scorn				7475.033809088286
i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase				1692.035780686085
ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely				6135.586095188715
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised				39342.6626849003
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god s anger ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilian s face				649.1409242148119
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket you see then said d artagnan that i must have that letter				903.6630565493812
impostor indeed m				288.4530067890296
a paltry piece of business murmured d artagnan crumpling his note				4822.407466969212
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard				911.5743404049133
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything				1752.0906082252764
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this world s affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east				5982.57096836871
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation				686.2509137123191
did you not say she was dead three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved				3163.9484451230596
who him him m				291.741192060947
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself				217.81695873366073
i have francs remaining he said				216.5271761382888
d artagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding milady				572.2418354536171
except your signature and your partner s m morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow				1129.3774224995007
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again				632.7447126866608
carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino				25156.572888316605
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes				23435.850678067352
bonacieux we must have them back again yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am i to act				1848.2307337660704
on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly				9348.899867803251
i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again				744.1599885652944
the devil thou dost not				294.4835377563812
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight				41557.46229874284
our swords cried d artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession				3064.104521394655
do you think so sir				293.4906156958777
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment				761.2342286240236
now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied château renaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile				401.03094016474347
the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication				2390.8760613204936
the english repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie were obliged to re embark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to paris by claude de st simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame				2092.8263499624272
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible				1087.659198952035
on my word i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen how did it arise				14021.357512098897
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot				1879.693735195223
what are your excellency s orders inquired gaetano				5356.587862283872
i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion and of what did he die asked caderousse in a choking voice				496.2923861454357
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury				6546.837856226734
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end horrible ejaculated the priest				1465.407122201492
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood				5506.700452664854
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him				48.225336328913905
if these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them				99.5845452831276
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant				4806.906189606842
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord				728.9302196222706
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me adieu then until five o clock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one at tréport yes or in the neighborhood but can we travel forty eight leagues in eight hours easily said monte cristo				162.12064159396385
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line				2924.731571198382
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary				3190.8139214849684
he hastened to his cabinet				5883.952992859251
no one could guess what the dirty rag could be i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man				317.3349340465133
oh no self love beauchamp				366.5408426559954
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame				2061.244836118724
indeed when placed beside m de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison				11916.567849154464
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man				291.71337077939955
come and i will explain to you and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went				5947.834882344354
in the first place do you accept asked the cardinal				224.10092320198638
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court				1320.9578599099398
noirtier s eye remained immovable				4678.113527103994
when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity oh yes said château renaud				257.08738979702093
i knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him of what oh that is not my secret i must not therefore tell you besides said d artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as i am i remind you of prudence besides i believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences				92803.00773843964
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage				1007.1408350358415
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress				1595.8779310361401
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room				187.96076315127212
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit				3669.677414785059
no more theses no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions hey aramis smiled				635.9482713309308
the queen gave them to me the queen requires them again				524.0880068342159
gentlemen said athos a wager ah wooi a vager cried the swiss				8755.174776054819

i will go said comminges and if they come back fire not at all not at all replied d artagnan let no one move				5096.990585923348
one day he miraculously left the prison transformed rich powerful				9239.382693203239
i thought so madame stammered the young girl				1124.001198678833
she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them madame said villefort believe me a fortune of francs is not so easily renounced she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent never mind replied villefort i say that this marriage shall be consummated notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack				3241.915134793267
pardon me monsieur but you are not my lord the duke of buckingham said mme				68.36501006732715
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother				743.756995922642
no more than a drop of water in the ocean remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the abbé				388.3608927758166
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos				524.850520234694
they all four entered the tent they had no plan ready they must think of one				786.1642627058358
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it				115.58549706094651
they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room				248.75987537641038
this letter had been conveyed by d artagnan and had arrived in time				440.8989403964537
at six o clock villefort retired to his study at eight m d avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m noirtier was carried away				478.41284511330815
a true friend s eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me				51.00319826842674
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him				43.132035932391126
take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever				2700.941630982393
the unknown chapter				296.4015848718086
i guessed it				87.77445789493338
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there won t be any parliament at all and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it				60.76026128121316
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu				26868.899564225227
how will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv support a double weight the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing				1841.305226578141
do we breakfast or dine				4495.668238081927
yes very well				591.2383966960615
when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished dressing i am going to her and villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife				1224.9978996632535
afterward afterward				5609.433480000839
admirable said d artagnan				1.1578480034676042
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased				11629.702148696024
but was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards				38742.90757360834
still dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation				29128.583213700625
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves				3559.1824481312815
that m danglars speculates whereas he never does truly madame i recollect m debray told me apropos what has become of him				46.18107471634795
she had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman				1330.992636944816
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos				471.8405008125443
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel well perhaps				3349.1815803150876
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbé				1975.691201623737
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				489.032323671118
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people				789.0252332948515
at one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing				46882.49782021767
i confess it replied albert				44.45338993891499
silence child				1100.2603331887215
with your lasso you could stop an ox again ali repeated his affirmative gesture				2012.4345494579031
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances				8557.762458379233
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank				5995.564899380749
what is there astonishing in that and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me no so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel for you alone the deuce				2856.8412846405654
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know it how do i know it said d artagnan				1.7039842352819987
in his eyes and to his conviction mme				134.47222212449475
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps				1054.600681000773
danglars then opened the window				607.2706952138429
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him				46.73922508809117
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m bertuccio and to a king s attorney at that				536.0152013318016
mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold beautiful and satirical				37380.624059425674
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers				1147.7293711030763
read said he read				19819.25422317699
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down				753.4882476024846
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation ah said d artagnan a singular commission who is this monsieur oliver cromwell inquired porthos				25.85439244175493
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud				1319.5061507836685
but surely you are monsieur d artagnan and thou planchet cried the lieutenant				908.7516097468216
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray				20866.095375880042
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation				39255.03844540237
he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwell s letter				704.84550014552
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching				3206.0224356897766
poor concino concini				12207.959607456985
presently it sounded one o clock				1076.6342722125605
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her				169.80920831687118
ah you are awake madame he said then i have nothing more to do here				619.4541765297399
oh mercy mercy monsieur what i require is that justice be done				689.1362586888621
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating				38121.01721153906
the cardinal s guards cried aramis and porthos at the same time				440.38248057742953
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required				4920.518571836775
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things				3077.0213085849346
we must never look for discretion in first love				938.7123772287009
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence				3017.526473137191
do you see cried the lieutenant				1213.6758892670018
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name				764.3725124478518
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes				6183.071223842555
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away				479.08400301518134
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly				5854.142582061207
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly				2637.4486047922414
let us strive i beseech you let us strive to be cheerful yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind				626.6365735018272
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs				3533.0477155891936
in what in a pate for example in a pate said la ramee				734.8795805326661
the warm pressure made d artagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself				180.7089940915412
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause				3315.922315691372
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge				5745.6619692945815
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart				159.50197322859825
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself what signal the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose				2103.367073983327
poor child chapter				208.9330437714121
but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude				19182.568949520883
come fanny we will put her to bed m d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered				43310.91058044811
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards well provided you replace your pistols in your belt willingly and d artagnan set the example				1344.3690019904184
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance				3678.556320664883
you say she is in a convent replied porthos				13.816305952531293
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them				117.09791929878594

sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate				3980.7312395655595
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark				31515.398432400485

the two friends were in the via dei pontefici				36080.58710215534
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince				928.4115479889202
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre				4240.963395008166
in the first horseman she recognized d artagnan				1.056609869151508
god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space				6246.476330550785
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him				43.06549150966698
yes look at yourself in that glass you have turned pale and then red successively three or four times in one minute indeed cried eugénie you are very pale oh do not be alarmed i have been so for many days artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides madame de villefort came to her assistance				2661.956084449487
and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of				2731.7150584067513
at the same time continued d artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey yes indeed said porthos				148.59989409319263
ah said d artagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold				2267.7662135089145

i shall find many men as able as you are i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort				433.62486515201647
there is no hurry you know				547.0298880404293
it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the the francs of m de boville and on the the francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man				282.0298941566879
the father of m de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money a thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto fidelis et fortis				53843.91108899481
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled				16024.931033348024
under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action				2052.874976440532
what hinders it exclaimed the king				323.5337870623658
as for you you have acted like a barmaid				28749.195156281832
the result was that to prevent mm				5334.361303976468
ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty				10327.73261863044
it was this gentleman said d artagnan bowing to the officer				1474.0186966422377
do you again defy me no the fact is i have found my father what				631.8760651380043
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort				3229.7688914982878
he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death				1009.415906764933
he seated himself at his desk and d artagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter				724.6885647952035
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s website and official page at www gutenberg org contact section				4562.703610159618
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m de tréville				1298.0682896544638
morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six				1683.89198118155
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind				639.2524788315809
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat				1790.1916719647008
in the proper time and place i will remember everything				573.7188528683242
athos remained a musketeer under the command of d artagnan till the year at which period after a journey he made to touraine he also quit the service under the pretext of having inherited a small property in roussillon				25776.683160921533

the door opened and d artagnan went into the chamber				707.5893414627885
no i did not say i was a stranger to you				91.18721105551735
he denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it				67.08978516082857
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered d artagnan shaking his head doubtfully				14610.23426326052
let us then take advantage of it then aloud well my dear la ramee				1002.6849493043434
besides kitty would not like to live in the rue aux ours				3592.3284423677733
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him				42.07259472667469
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine				1444.6121291991847
i remember too well				456.0819725992872
general oliver cromwell the four friends looked at one another				1021.5396011816791
possessed by one single thought that of the promise he had made and of the responsibility he had taken he retired last to his chamber begged the host to procure him a map of the province bent over it examined every line traced upon it perceived that there were four different roads from béthune to armentières and summoned the lackeys				3309.957246286107
d artagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy				652.8675422560171
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task				3224.2293817064324

noirtier s room was opened like all the rest				1311.9642988665687
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them				115.54846540528963
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish				30517.382309249482
let us save them half of their journey and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight				3578.282330603207

everything count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history				3101.6575001404317
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward				5928.817774601232
the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort				1258.7658062290634
she thinks of me then after five years of separation				4080.163599463193
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart				163.71894488464912
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel				1332.308316286656
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it				95.20524566563657

shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess				2318.4251008000365
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard these announced the arrival of the queen				474.0171197793029
explain yourself grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole				18498.698654428736
you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugénie i am not aware of it said albert smiling sorrowfully				2676.8779853956407
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her				140.2467321591799
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter dated from villeroy m d artagnan mm				5521.082323312752
will you eat any of these beans cousin porthos said mme				82.48580900460689
how happy you are in being exempt from all this well and why should not you be free too				2187.0952044129185
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave				1270.0995801395893
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself				272.56945625076537
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel i know it monsieur replied villefort and i am now going to examine him oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do				729.5912706961178

she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself you have been free to choose your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze				39968.546389108036
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos				12.51016447008246

at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinal s treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orange tree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from not even the cardinal it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos				247.49059127190512
bonacieux had made with him for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess				3097.16168756636
well i shall write to the abbé i shall hold him responsible for his protégé s misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination				6427.801169847246

yes if i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right				1221.573300460418
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy				3696.6183502078425
a bad relapse that will lead you if i mistake not to the place de grève				25312.25153712406

d artagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m de tréville who detected him at once				1307.0856316456384
this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois				3523.8680017589586
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way				627.9401135491521
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says				7955.04550268809
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot				44028.256448896216
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from d artagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence				7675.058257842052
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through arras				16397.177608400198

d artagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared				527.4024325546752
my dear friend cried aramis				12.454008175348992

the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier				6508.744821623656
i had better get on horseback and go and meet her				118.19541854481581

she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor				5706.758385394624
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction				4989.223818601964

the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercédès				1409.7367128446022
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for d artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin				14785.444084952018
and i also said franz				134.45067907596749

humanity in a battle				1805.5508187171247
d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds				28153.20949879081
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand				203.530122949401
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars				197.62932211762137

the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen				457.1673841239803
do you think emmanuel would oblige me i will answer for him count well				517.1300309802863

oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed				2546.727760232259
at this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage				63985.268576125454
do you hear ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows as you will valentine shall you be happy if i do what you wish oh yes valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening				3773.1314272515865
this garden has never been a cemetery what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently				60547.459136318306
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee				4243.1358465963995
he must wait				1610.8398919240983
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart				197.56609920258143
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed how so asked beauchamp				158.77433255710955
for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the rue st denis or the faubourg st germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes				10316.7466544781
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours				3121.6733223883434
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan who was counting on his fingers				2389.9869810034675
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost mad what will not reality do but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you which asked the young man				219.48146268510496
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room				190.55263858439292
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening planchet cried d artagnan beside himself with joy				971.0425469894404
d artagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison				1167.590392563816

if she flies kill her but don t exceed your orders an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning				1386.1545652540162
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated				22624.32835483442
the devil exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord				459.270183461363
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way				600.948944041184
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the king s commissioner la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window				614.2327430266812
adieu i entreat you doctor all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal				36894.74167833565
my dear d herblay who can say whether d artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal				424.35181289745395
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step				1324.7457205765957
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state				7508.492393195125
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself				1701.911796650798
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him				59.37248083633312
i tell you what m franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert well then hearken to me i listen you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question i do neither can we procure horses true we have offered any sum but have failed well now what do you say to a cart				9692.259638074998
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail and thus they took me to nîmes				5993.826935183505
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton how can you doubt it sir				413.182959179648
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard				921.0363787002929

sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour half an hour s rest is enough replied the gascon				228.56243816114494
the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future				1807.7527580135757
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor				2489.7942336817155
d artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence				977.4198616597844

only a few days replied monte cristo				42.96028478180644
but how asked mazarin				63.79582880557572
a gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments i am of aramis s opinion said porthos				97.10318663277927
like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display				33986.532935779935
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither				5348.333880203746
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn				792.8207778487381
yes shall i call him yes valentine went to the door and called barrois				3211.469409844218
but to return to our millions certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world				565.1498793116388
and why not				296.1886690997743
i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish				2150.0930748823234
this gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel				4930.8154488917435

to morrow night we shall rescue you how can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy				662.584192363504

athos arrested				2197.728184585906
let us get ready gentlemen but this second letter said athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened				1612.3030342499515
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep				957.6810867616658
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better				1246.6804173665817

each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance				2032.7679075367869
you can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you no i really can not well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it				84.71271665542642

the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage				2941.1910032274973
she had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of san felice s daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her				155.30724611354478
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see yes i see they are about to send into our court which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him there they are coming out if only they close the guardhouse door				245.21170153998963

true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue				8191.800986505485
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands				543.2593976221459

oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips				467.2272597244991
on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable				36417.50177868347
i will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved go said valentine whatever happens i promise you not to fear monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her				136.99315141485465
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state				5148.585613642003

everything goes as if in flowery paths everything goes too well porthos				240.84710922755752
i am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage				5370.695485582931
if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husband s chest m coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a siesta				56884.66145078052
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance good said milady to herself who knows				3124.979608296836
tell me then				233.86451566768667
at eight o clock all were in their places and m de morcerf entered at the last stroke				8641.397622640123
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions				4570.27249827192
a dinner in the old style				2304.555002908047
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				232.08739209096558
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton				106.41118725151532
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saint méran with an air of deep interest				2972.9745655710494
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur d artagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment				1139.4581753403097
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris pshaw				21665.25695986596
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs				14509.247239000779
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another				1074.7651426751306
she descended and went through the passage				2287.993971056039

the breakfast chapter				186.14736745243422
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him				49.265941934322214
it s tiresome work to keep awake a whole night yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream				859.5644930432491
let us wait by all means				1785.4500729466772
i have eight men on guard you know				617.148027231952
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death grimaud hesitated				1555.1526620573384
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head				364.93638582370454
i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself				597.8341700576988
yes my lord ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling				157.88565236206227
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs				1081.2006828662352
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dantès knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor				1702.9914802422795
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine noirtier nodded his head				367.35604923449745
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				165.56092222683432
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the king s attorney true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise				2017.7529705772065
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke				212.0100466012061
then you were going to rueil yes				556.5745842851617

debray is with madame danglars nodded his head then turning to monte cristo said m				325.0039442534025
i am going to fire gentlemen exclaimed d artagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are about				2154.195911051078
the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénie s character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection				4840.220041179874
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten				5252.621393118156
to morrow we shall retake lens and beat the enemy then turning toward raoul go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to monsieur de grammont raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop				881.0468154814242
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father				786.818311971731
it was this that made me start when you said the other day at m de morcerf s that messrs thomson french were your bankers				23922.22926139264
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him in that case go and get ready				1122.3751845633974
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder				1246.1692835258482
they resumed their route				1565.2228085550878
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table				560.3420930825283
he appears cool				11792.346444889396
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet				947.8760342827422
the carriage stopped at the door of the house				389.1687677035743
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air				809.5633725970196
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one				775.7620115886656
what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé d herblay ah his friend is with him said raoul				171.77506768311235
well asked danglars				108.06264707064005
you are almost a boy i see that you require someone to answer for me i admit that would reassure me greatly do you know athos no porthos no aramis no				386.1897653998085
here i await thee there was profound silence				845.6855419087143
it is done gentlemen said athos				8.165265791319746
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous				7189.780461934463
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no				353.3964191972657
d artagnan pressing his hand repeated his call				5202.166259515102
and since i do not give it said the musketeer				749.6353921919277
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although i am only your brother in law i will arrange one similar my first husband cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets				8812.918052549432
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swords they saw the light of day i presume that is the night my lord i answered				4056.1792978484955
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it				95.89678685786096
come let us come to the point				2349.812185741753
although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them				113.42502478533372
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed				12819.186497205757
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude				1985.6978266762583
i know them by their romantic imagination				2765.1429234685215
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him				47.899250419057495
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture				3758.9769909809975
he said very good muttered the major then sir replied he				7.5503815670214225
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth				28171.230938459328
hey said the cardinal opening the door				383.83781555006874
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating				17415.796253817323
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was				1332.118376887912
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass				1294.251171624414
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondy s suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow ah				268.5099251433775
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house				387.8408716634347
no you are right my dear rochefort it couldn t be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon ah indeed				619.8459726282191
no this is his blood where were you then where you left me under the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all				253.4105281726827
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile				376.3713633547254
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say				771.9480061276836
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti				1779.5038195747666
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after				4470.955221397052
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name				766.9968984125172

although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words				909.9943725923677

the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation				4949.755347359484

all was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall				2010.9803161284603

there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident as to the rest m de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously				10140.965925102073

ah my poor friends murmured d artagnan where are you				252.87301830563086
d artagnan was perplexed				35403.41624751797
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i brother in law of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr				44510.387126837464
at that moment d artagnan opened his eyes				606.7959873104885

therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort				3514.8529212777053
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain				35098.369587823545
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale				760.1594641906579
your highness s most devoted servant in the bastile as elsewhere comte de rochefort the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster				36406.91053608427
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent				2168.525558868744
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles				1852.2070470373487

d artagnan took charge of it				112.0500339498024
it is god s pleasure that things should be so the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce				35685.3424533593

the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair				918.6599488662195
it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he				44.06650996717657
d art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand				196.0448927253174
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses				3737.618483461357
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune				1373.7118049163755
not so foolish as all that ah muttered athos i may be mistaken i haven t the unerring eye of d artagnan who is speaking of monsieur d artagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room				290.56528084394847
the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men				392.7448902538171
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother				774.0921783161765
but first let haydée be informed that i have returned here i am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely				37622.13821914152
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person				829.9163567016946

the abbé shook his head				336.00251488579846
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				4456.077924967469
now to supper said aramis				9.992812199870713
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to you there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching				3173.3100997340666
remember raoul this				651.48522807622
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation				5011.65617476509
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him				46.44107741398524
question then my lord where did the army cross the lys between saint venant and aire by whom is it commanded by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke of how many does it consist eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon and its aim is lens you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers				4114.110325588732
the king looked around him				41.168358504743466
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here madame those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been for they are the agents of the cardinal and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille my husband in the bastille cried mme				181.09060706999205
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway				4624.551155503069
speak sir				244.93567767826445
in the first place you have plenty of money haven t you				78.61278757936918
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocer s or druggist s gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced then when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood				5200.990594535208
now m le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young man s implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to d avrigny				2032.4722927556686
porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration				1922.0904920506587
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying if she had committed two crimes i would say here m de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with one that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations				27889.37343275082
adieu mademoiselle				8438.805155383592
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them then aloud oh madame m danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars				254.7841503611901
as the count s title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me				128.76706144531508
i know it and now the ranks began to open				2588.019784171298
what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand				197.7619580711331
what is it asked he				7.015316277969754
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away				485.0212272331295
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty				3507.3122614147364
besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of m de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance				7676.595508017554
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun				2615.332049059858
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar				3012.0235074682237
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii				992.6931660976468
how grateful will m de villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child				1177.1867929282507
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow				2330.050965846689
i believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the matter then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her you aramis cried the three friends				500.6136358374162
well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part i am indeed rejoiced said andrea				552.6025856227659
a servant entered summoned by albert s ring of the bell				2395.054602894751
but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him oh				1015.233076373179
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously				6188.4217866348
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms				508.70378018654316
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine				1397.4293915951366
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse				27693.140055279615
ma madame cried he is that you				70.99706718099205
no my lord these places are bought				22971.9106727596
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house				389.37146305249905
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii				868.6780226398929
this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions				1595.5172701687038
no one had entered the house since i had left it				58.4043261532628
i recognized it on your finger you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts asked porthos				24.09157310988879
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling				3424.5693405589986
therefore if you part with m baptistin give me the refusal of him by all means that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search ah ha you will do as much as that will you yes well really nothing is certain in this world oh count what a service you might render me				104.61277683700652
abraham raised the knife against isaac and isaac was his son yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain cromwell bowed				844.3590701697764
the house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics				23982.07671945588
they laugh best who laugh last having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée d antin				5098.3615353256155
are you not well tis nothing nothing it will soon pass away and as he said so the old man s strength failed him and he fell backwards				4671.172287108941
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak				1054.1783524417535
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach				1346.4424570652939
grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor				2478.2976388613124
very well done the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him				63.51412253679438
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed				637.79223565861
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward				12810.142945283767
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him				52.99058366713064
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest				10358.547691590558
what will you do with the letter then asked porthos				14.10214984666712
hallo fernand				970.5601904385614
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris she inquired				3474.2581505661597
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				3957.591843105241
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage				1035.204429137387
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin that s all very well replied d artagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh				1107.176338894016
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot				23223.486339870942
that was the sloop				4074.1639746499013
this time said d artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france				818.4284826228878
it is but you will not look will you it is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table				669.8714311539046
go away he said				176.15844711287681
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head				353.57660502703186
an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii				987.4146899796344
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist				16244.008190213588
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal				36849.134209333984
morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me no count but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them				99.3122084799254
i only wait till you give them you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made yes for i have the proofs i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation without doubt				1131.5843141339956
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it				72.21520997395767
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house				484.68506826678436
a man the discussion is going to begin again said mme				82.48722497951555
no madame i will not thus waste your time				444.3128835610647
go monsieur duke and return often				17932.785524140414
besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france				849.1157053262976
if you wish it i am at your service my lord i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled what do you mean				2093.804557124875
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives				3472.7277381646395
speak gentlemen speak i am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing				871.7715126735759
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said				341.5677885490243
that did not come from a man without a heart				158.03019182861036
what is this rent said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through				2166.9502641682316
and then he a wanderer on the earth a man without fortune a man without family a soldier accustomed to inns cabarets taverns and restaurants a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats was about to partake of family meals to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is the more they please as old soldiers say				797.320151806492
and that one if i mistake not a lamprey just so				266.03127379483254
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all				477.853353721132
yes sir replied mousqueton				108.11676531725868
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel down with mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten				9256.75739243872
your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is porthos s purse too he put it into his pocket				821.654444952485
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m d épinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed				3791.34324921245
an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself				281.9572830455222
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory				2804.129680508951
bonacieux to join her				120.00126553103077
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert				55.82354959121098
it was from mme				204.64478315348893
to think of the parisians soliloquized d artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs				1019.3912813368727
you don t know them				237.58858027767846
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort				326.69413069784116
they are quite new and have not yet been used				3136.692880640247
hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them				101.96605746423243
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded				48557.571259855606
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door				208.73826413239794
that will serve us for a relay said athos				8.945558056815258
the tutor followed them				94.06291897468263
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged				5205.948046792506
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch				19383.08666085408
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice				3476.5484028485857
and what is your choice asked jussac				750.2247079205414
let us alight raoul said athos				8.335241236234069
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat				2037.7610747248284
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety				1799.6251488709338
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance				1948.699130620191
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them				102.50087841131229
i believed him still at brussels oh sir if you know who this man is cried d artagnan tell me who he is and whence he is				993.8530846956602
grimaud rose				3092.176931731891
what can he be looking for thought edmond				757.770546332793
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad hashish statues all became a dream for franz				1240.0070605813603
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her				219.77438337452338
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men				435.58198978239125
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat				2722.9523370366355
mouston appeared with a most piteous face				638.1907612952012
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications				23642.534747619753
d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal				486.1365648499853
himself captain himself very well show him to me at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt				23593.11773648235
whom would they hang yourself or me				72.16164914896993
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there				518.2055265575324
the boat is waiting for us come besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time				454.09487862970127
will that do capitally replied m de busigny				24458.39277371482
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray				174.0256279927711
the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from m duchâtel or from m montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek words têle graphein				29054.34089820781
while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could dear valentine well would you believe it				59.38018192910725
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career				4167.662742980328
d avrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemist s to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughter s room				212.98897141251385
well said danglars did you see him i have just left him answered caderousse				99.6566070161013
this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame				783.492225462046

this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church				1081.138817836897
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				28515.04991314761

then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him				60.1208312863076
too late by a minute cried he too late by a minute				2670.1430664964714
he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left				880.8846656825997
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me				76.90378123288878
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair				1346.9022317450633

that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part				2454.464922995789
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydée seemed one of fire and blood				1867.4596824002506

many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations				31742.257903553964

monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself				251.11843554823906

he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents sign it continued the count				441.8563464942355
her mouth was small and rosy and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt				2570.8028796401463
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal				8246.536401846486
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme				128.88420625256873

oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done				621.8498884117032
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm				3648.551414256039
never mind in the meantime he marries mercédès the lovely mercédès at least he returns to do that during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead				9422.215212510844
but this is tyranny cried one of them in very good french though with a foreign accent that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine				1294.5437323876008
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose				2018.3486228876295
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him				69.28908906724851
he began by asking m bonacieux his name age condition and abode				2821.0226395358536

the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness				22428.898251613882

copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced				1890.406342531292
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the cask				5957.445838480016
on her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously				4106.963960114069
i should like however to know what this letter addressed to tréville contains and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the kitchen				3574.7418916953798

i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences				11715.9977732066
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so				509.8718754786303

he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailor s jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair				2955.4013800680705
call for help useless said athos useless				11028.067896178834
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous teresa gave him one only instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him was a lad of fifteen replied peppino				2506.426784963456
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of d artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late d artagnan had already recognized mme				262.7375297444102
she would not be weary thank god				310.3271393931795
she has taken care for herself at least i hope so for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me				97.3566057037831
are you there asked porthos				14.922101374574243
for pity s sake cried the young man whose agony drawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble				27465.814546455276
au revoir not farewell				7057.640002334524
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love				927.0808575575597
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret				10852.994088998685
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust				7075.991488980653
i have then about fifty pistoles				2646.5961082477743
i will bless you i i am dying cried mordaunt come to me				48.47659500642915
at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string and are you going there i am what telegraph do you intend visiting				48534.145009646265
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution				2270.996357052585
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace				6293.763195855924
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment still my lord i can t travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i can t travel on my savings for in my twenty two years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to d artagnan take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought d artagnan we shall yet be able to do business together he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket				901.1436548961799
monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story				2637.634741117808
and now farewell farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror				1061.965201510926
the road to picardy				9325.747488648012
really villefort you surprise me				49.32851689650132
you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter				1831.0000794080954
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two o clock				1301.3765450971541
while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye				2477.9655909302405
i do not know for i have never had it madame have you any friends i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where				7068.949883235004
here he said take this pocket book do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison				1167.4567800929924
the four friends followed ten paces behind him				44.715465817099386
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood				17741.65290484206
yes if i am killed said albert laughing				532.550397347189
she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number and he undertook to call and take d artagnan with him in order to introduce him				47.05896213803077
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme				215.70492392049377
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey				21468.261241449934
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me oh oh said d artagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso				20984.553546084757
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt				34242.640997877366
the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus				31955.478710100175
but how is it he is not already returned				1011.1439041334453
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom you say either too much or too little speak madame				849.7418959249262
the fourth as we have said was dead				2647.8748183613884
i understand he said you confess but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime can not be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty the punishment exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur				633.6091160414387
shall i knock hush replied d artagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window do you hear nothing whispered planchet				350.17724671967557
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues				3774.103103750053
oh you beautiful good little creature said milady				42.00452006650602
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work				892.900859770923
the elder prisoner pondered the matter				1149.0918117923525
he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtier s room				211.56065406534566
speak to the governor then and where is the governor in the country anger mounted to d artagnan s face he frowned and his cheeks were colored				2959.807142742432
a merry morning to you sunshine				48148.8721740019
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon				42984.97024728981
to dinner said d artagnan				1.0872836100581103
he resembles his mother so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in				790.9991778651705
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear				3420.711193541262
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will				1083.3718067069915
well then a good journey to you said caderousse				51.779844973698125
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				8482.893496246365
where is my son asked villefort let him be removed from the house that he may not see master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet				1940.440189006111
can i be of service to your majesty said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity				1753.060848040223
when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen				324.4066043395846
i will be an abbé if it suits me				86.89986587244776
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women				1408.2975637281681
when i returned she was married				7656.773987428129
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned				2449.636009710964
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends				574.4963193062894
you are speaking you scoundrel said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look				1437.762702959106
her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed				620.6199505992536
did anyone introduce you to him no it was he who introduced himself to us when last night after we left you through what medium the very prosaic one of our landlord he is staying then at the hôtel de londres with you not only in the same hotel but on the same floor what is his name for of course you know the count of monte cristo that is not a family name no it is the name of the island he has purchased and he is a count a tuscan count well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families				28037.72783654353
then you can let me have some money can you not whatever you say my dear count i am at your orders why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case danglars bowed assentingly				23935.16830623043
chapter iv				1009.2777753643795
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture				1926.678580144718
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out				212.0152024715726
do you think they will grant it without doubt how many are they four and the two bandits make six just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to monte cristo yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permit i exhort you silence then said gaetano				4143.452547582362
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter				803.8073812504309
i found the tenant				8713.950039733492
ah said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds				47467.08241739008
what are these things he asked				733.8731692800918
have a care cried porthos to his opponent i ve still two pistols charged the more reason you should fire the first cried his foe				85380.96183555269
let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves				2083.882044196979
you have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her				121.1714399421286
you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door				223.1805128965112
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her				128.40071308015723
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness				1003.8225574366527
the countenance of old dantès brightened				6123.474066880437
you ve killed him i think no wounded his horse only what would you have my dear fellow				1371.9842498959258
this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person my dear doctor there is no communication between m noirtier s apartment and that of madame de saint méran and barrois never entered my mother in law s room				210.69335565823118
god knows how much i love revere you see that you forget nothing said athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion				1275.8868078696703
on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire				2033.4048369227494
she is called the fair indian excuse me sir returned raoul blushing still more deeply i know no more than i did before				890.3142391890502
does your majesty require anything further				3436.5336751881505
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dantès				417.77005890899267
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsar s podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin				3550.740666021525
my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me as he spoke dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked and started				864.6846416661582
the one you bought will then become useless to you nearly so and you selected it yourself with the greatest care				2262.5805652141107
will you go up with me i follow you monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories				2762.430734348497
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay				2940.984847486354
these men are going to behead your father				568.5152106210312
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brother s thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry				2554.9794156440485
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is monsieur d artagnan and his friends he will bring them to us he knows them then doubtless				9115.304686843363
that name written in her hand you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still chapter lxiv				1010.4888732038183
about seven o clock in the morning they set out				356.66899489299516
what are you doing asked the coadjutor				3953.9249683197927
d artagnan himself was moved by them				113.38776615754853
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart				163.99811701402325
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way and you will pay ready money and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank notes which might have been twice the sum m de boville feared to lose				4247.022332307706
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m				325.65905864968084
just so gentlemen				1080.7646098937298
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them				134.75561609563644
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said d artagnan				1.6281942045061855
was he awake or was it but a dream				840.0611874990904
albert rejoined his mother she was very pale				925.034141457342
a knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied felton				267.3361081100052
a ball had passed through his breast				961.2950294854119
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir				721.5294641419468
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear d artagnan very good said d artagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there				444.1895953017065
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today a fine pleasure indeed monsieur				757.4367480393571
each person s attention was occupied				35314.729959151264
yes and important				9222.691445725537
bread and salt chapter				192.06538578571954
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich and to have ideas added madame danglars				325.9702457733463
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility				5744.746967287882
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period				4544.486232290629
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush				5178.767578280124
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead				26108.701228439175
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling				534.7714026018895
have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers				18821.162824664963
no but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted				5300.921275679393
but i repeat to you i am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how				1731.782179265033
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your love a second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman				869.8253349461042
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke				218.7227585295092
now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter you are right it was left on board then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio no and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel i carried it in my hand so that when you went on board the pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand yes danglars as well as the rest danglars as well as others now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest				3204.322915611205
the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glance but there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened				36242.77668579166
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young man s head fell on his breast				935.7779467693816
oh said d artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly				18075.950760197193
you must take grimaud and olivain both sir asked raoul astonished				774.7819940192411
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me				56.36521682723327
ah said d artagnan there are two of them then i wish there were four said athos the two parties would then be equal perhaps there are four said d artagnan				20.27811502243465
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected				20889.350893935232
when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him				45.81390206239386
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m de wardes				2318.8065335503193
unfortunately i didn t crush him flat				35787.82413549132
diable a pallor overspread the young man s forehead and he looked around him with anxiety				1668.0287699862427
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint méran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentine s mother				722.2330493718226
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind				671.0895259418115
there s the sun				2732.0055499148793
apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent				6279.410319040208
it is enough replied the prince				931.2060905763716
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs				21489.01115063571
they are only four a joyous smile lighted porthos s face				628.1395623867048
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as d artagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him				43.17069856325168
are we softened a little				1000.7089271135256
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them				130.0554541481388
now for the tally ho athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms				489.9225149222245
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air				754.2517686827027
he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently				7196.057088771071
charles s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death				812.6265097941948
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man father i will said maximilian				247.49684602458288
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation				681.6316455522172
the camp had entered saint omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen				447.84187487829774
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall				33731.76131182232
come but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase				1631.4195911987147
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentine s room opened and monte cristo reappeared				3051.3379844924157

on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice				2865.8831813361376
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds a boar s ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster				17208.628581568468
the count s serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand				200.65501793488662
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte				4718.740407633044
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of				2063.1465991932605
it must have been charming indeed				886.675365521113
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart				169.91701537820003
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained				16046.555157208097
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word				749.7776723885735
we shall both get into trouble				4267.895929976448
he recognized the influence of mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless				1602.6405356296748
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison				1171.523205624338
stand aside he cried stand off the road what do you want asked a voice				223.3659748794716
bah cried porthos				15.84397794642021
d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it				69.27333096433797
the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty				5261.987086900099
good heavens				1478.7361404251667
yes keen and cutting politeness				5788.241177914113
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table				520.8522754690241
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chief s consent did the same				1182.122751563467
a propos inform bazin will bazin go with us asked aramis				12.328436827872993
oh the devil				1187.0658217657058
but what if i were mistaken a shudder passed over him				45.196521950489505
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started				850.3859844489506
i shall follow the count s directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out				228.5236420595348
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother				805.6799910643114
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror				1251.8809008817802
have i any need to tell you so				218.05618313700361
and then there are robbers said la carconte				1348.1462077201618
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late you see said athos pointing to mme				70.13142482887115
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing				2287.8030539267825
impossible madame impossible edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond why do you not call me mercédès mercédès repeated monte cristo mercédès				1354.4530929471268
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place				674.2454073775259
although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five				1558.9466263218198
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition				3656.6433219630717
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it the devil it does				4843.928103628491
we are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost mousqueton heaved a deep sigh				1512.8053850043607
then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to m de tréville who made some advances on their pay but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all				431.97222074634817
at eleven o clock albert had not come back				800.3140669494804
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm				3145.439893659189
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery				13245.95429721356
bravo cried d artagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis				23.351978995662353
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before				713.3410524657663
why to me why you killed him				67.93773949247753
yes said athos by his own nephew come he was the first of us to go peace be to him				45.32207116622979
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best				2213.944091963813
devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment and he wiped his eyes still moist				24684.191672063454
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck				23401.211190937152
captivity the fifth day chapter lvii				1562.3355827719483
i defended the king and who told you to defend the king the comte de la fere himself yes the king but to day you have not fought for the king you have fought for mazarin which is not quite the same thing but you yourself oh for me that is another matter				886.2509761556674
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven				724.3627764422937
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel				22247.882982872965
there was a moment s silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir				239.1450643410258
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs				23643.571945165528
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory				13990.942938876493
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock				8076.9370182178345
there s a carriage coming over yonder then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name that s right				1045.4929806023806
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night and even for all day to morrow if you want it				72.46304901328533
morrel looked around uneasily				1358.6783852693557
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled				806.3510454340344
bring here immediately the king s attorney m de villefort who lives in the faubourg saint honoré				5966.013958874603
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				1117.9083013892898
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords				2070.8748956591267
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty				2221.250946686293
hasten reverend sir hasten				53562.789818328354
the interior of the musketeers when d artagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress				1680.001409691479
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine chapter lii				3455.9112635986235
as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments				26970.254510928175
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				2636.9808066221754
it is not god s will that they should be accomplished				6536.10151779808
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death				876.3933414443871
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example				1508.6128794032181
another might threaten to seek m franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly				6097.925828557426
mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled by whom by the joices the prinns the cromwells by a tailor a coachmaker a brewer				26118.139730039333
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris				499.92185182465636
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inauspicious				30356.16800146697
the gratitude of anne of austria				1779.4987283807836
he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased				4780.847010935129
what for demanded porthos				17.846468728891598
how they must be asking where is the cardinal what has become of the minister where has the favorite gone how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners				8494.340356096987
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty no no blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu you know his father s name his father yes noirtier noirtier the girondin noirtier the senator he himself and your majesty has employed the son of such a man blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension				6345.297854336859
suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his watch it was half past four				3349.8811455977384
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign				2637.1681674326464
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen				271.89872145160643
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish it you are inflexible				32772.235584897506
no said felton it is nothing but what then is the noise that of the patrol going their rounds where is their road just under us they will discover us no if it does not lighten but they will run against the bottom of the ladder fortunately it is too short by six feet here they are				2427.605278277196
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers				2654.1460168957756
the blow was sped by d artagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom				1609.5492191912833
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams				15590.172973211314
the baroness was astonished				1658.5320498995543
monte cristo opened the carriage door morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps				923.360835514252
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo				253.65388692522455
felton give me that knife and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom				1807.6277717997452
at this time athos came up to d artagnan				1.2144087512596033
winter approached				3389.449294308552
there the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed				73694.64901441074
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit				5355.934021837655
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains				35568.97234227569
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face				627.0000240433008
i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell that is to say i am in the king s service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms				69294.97701504365
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview				4383.734899572851
excuse me mr president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you				125.36622119857664
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly				7167.469137443463
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them				127.68861349990078
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month				4741.16824199179
what are you waiting for said caderousse				47.02322964837113
come said he				6.3406484892181645
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal				447.26737341976104
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit				7055.641270478177
he had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary				3070.5019496634077
no no				335.62621232313586
lucullus dines with lucullus porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner but wine was wanting the bottle was empty				2043.8860164335763
pyramus and thisbe chapter				229.82471151957358
marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window				606.9276526008426
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed we hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire				3733.578558544191
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget				4720.563316969581
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room				233.93980060429536
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries				32104.543892815283
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel				1196.293378152193
come athos and aramis go to the right porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach paris he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route				1503.4882311217673
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses				5527.71533540782
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room				197.27709573693045
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud willingly said aramis				19.7358334775929
there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often wish for what is impossible what is that to find such a wife as my father found monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols				2267.8970612624616
that i think is as much as i shall want but your companions i don t think they can be in need of any				3067.5516830230868
a sort of smile played on his lips				487.1880222523647
the queen walked first every one followed her				123.08166659714973
your mother he said				184.16362044823356
nearly ten minutes passed i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart				166.3256923657148
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable				15399.63952242726
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy				630.820582889483
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison oh pardon me sir let me live she is cowardly said villefort				104.04371562932779
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives				4158.2258358429735
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see				1446.9961192622873
come down athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy				660.5731027379543
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting				13590.4063539872
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs				1138.8204773888847
that is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife but i have not told you that i know him cried bonacieux in despair				1336.8424848077616
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered				2647.6576591889425
a kind of steward appeared just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount				22651.487554349802
come said andrea you are a man void of compassion i ll have you turned out this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh				1099.3294822801124
as he approached it noirtier s gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart				170.83471764061014
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is said				271.5817789616698
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels				13943.017804150752
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter				223.17944869143312
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else the devil				1128.5957488502306
from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified				6608.632895030798
come come my little fellow don t be angry				4513.3843048219605
against calumniators said m de tréville				638.8642569308115
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve				8977.734286861247
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				568.474548698618
shall i draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his				1035.9648891819813
at your age no i was drunk				3963.850725439304
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound has he been wounded then oh good lord				451.2355550379196
you appear quite aghast				47655.04475008354
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks				1599.5706372195084
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards				1561.6473731894737
patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london				1656.9487341681115
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure				1903.1409811461
then all looked at each other he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free				2685.763923839397
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what				627.9733506236443
milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart				172.8980875383859
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish				2474.156724563009
woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison and woe to those who forgot that i was there as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman				860.417860606556
with the queen i double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe i might be forgotten				2012.3270767277372
read it obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him				56.23158164018128
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather sharply				5522.440941566442

franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible				972.7424241219636
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head				339.52239884672196
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess				2949.1973574077706
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment				3647.7233801442476

it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				1212.7653166716766
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face				620.6243896349323
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance				4513.074405955822
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished				26187.35152466264

here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal				294.9318206254105
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid				4112.886369027747
their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets				40624.876805441316
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied d avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study				2571.2957203190417
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted				28973.24103900876

two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared				897.6839332687795

he then arose				1601.6168366482063
ah your pardon said albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampa s torch				4029.4720761598714

la jeune amélie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible				1016.2666733875858
porthos abated no doubt of his too great confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and prudence				2868.881613984349
but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation				751.5416117758798

nothing was changed				11123.4375723418
but he will make it up in you i am sure				3567.36531683912
d artagnan did not know london he did not know a word of english but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s hôtel				2011.7763690624217
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step				1330.7419671875634
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon let me do what i please and do you what i do they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses				1128.5693794951997
why should that man give me a false diamond to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea				2149.5743638605545
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret				1331.5880875077462

have you a heart				209.70608176342594
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam				5311.163190567218
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair				920.1812447680294

my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer				9094.872915603994
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt				5363.135773102486
must you know all absolutely and rather from your lips than another s muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword				1166.160420192196
julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel				9416.924106874552
ah you fellows are good managers				43624.384210403965
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out				264.0563000715399
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting				2743.5354501405513
unfortunately said monte cristo one s title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts indeed said danglars becoming pale				772.8783704874322
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage				11021.002611986576
the park is twenty acres twenty comprising kitchen gardens and a common				21693.95424855544
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier				3158.097134885706
this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the allées de meilhan				7424.845577655853
there are four men come to arrest me				48.976144939566225
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head				345.2684410892138
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves				1960.4172064895747
for example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond st petersburg the other five leagues from naples				3787.111619969783
and shall we take no notice of this incident m de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held				3231.873317630871
he wished once again to press the count s hand but his own was immovable				3909.265613178697
we went by bologna perugia and rome ah yes true mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought				4160.70903833691
it was brought to me				56.99331275631997
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms				16645.042549496487
come come choose your part replied jussac				766.970931835956
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son				959.679220151041
what has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune				2268.1382302070697
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions				3255.9540788449317
the sea is the cemetery of the château d if				9213.522358595712
queer though				31688.359410336092
albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity				4796.9366888570485
the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses who cast bags of money at his feet				956.262845105485

scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son s room and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed				629.3213817260269
the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a rascal has with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence chalais s throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen				310.08485013918386

chapter lxii				1327.291971994328
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile				4309.396549684412
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate				39729.659830594734
providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner				826.58070071765
if he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost				800.7797781702117
what an awakening for the parisians said the queen radiant				48140.42394018787
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air				754.6629667026488
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady				968.1427664250972
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming				37689.32825419204
at that moment mme				93.52029241363819
noble and unhappy king are you wounded cried aramis				14.013154962740215
at nine o clock the night had fully come				1536.3926851073772
no its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it				85.88495359157267
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion				1259.6424417551368
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday				63514.8252089117
pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo				204.81533034723532
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide				27839.97270865396
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man				322.7337926985191
the pretty mme				253.74497983183392
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles and from fromelles she had set out for armentières				5445.5982695202065
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances				28181.5225646036
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais that is all i wished to know said the queen				201.5083773590441
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours				2854.595820482246
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m morrel to be admitted				2600.804073828882
you understand that is to say i guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said madeleine				14132.0696191436
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme				440.59000029822386
rochefort obeyed and retired				1424.0646953550795
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance it s of no importance				3384.646076359608
there was no further question therefore about marie michon among the four musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw mme				169.57900103873047
d artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords				2087.400624295335
not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment				18847.2791509287
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos				202.13043986306852
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down				941.2941717086466
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady				371.1419083375847
my lord has forgotten the supper no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present go on then have it your own way come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face				836.4470089300333
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows				1748.8378363178185
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller				52150.988867886386
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m de tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen				331.4654365856862
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women				1391.739083613304
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way perhaps replied d artagnan				1.7165953258289102
my own service said d artagnan				1.1224284132079472
no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers				27398.68434611554
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies				3630.3226132571763
your eminence may believe added d artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little				984.9350902862984
how my fault yes i offered you escape by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door certainly porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply faith said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much d artagnan shrugged his shoulders				979.4685194925183
we can find out his well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan				1.6469883789024242
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder				1259.2160564676954
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him				55.480904287356694
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent				4017.3739133714084
i buy those horses he said to the groom				4922.381875703635
finally said felton finally what did they do at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer				20092.560407358953
i am king of all creation				59408.990638059586
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money				759.7003505149063
there were only chimeras and illusions but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras				19316.76474913589
ah said the king i was unjust here is a creature that loves me				74.55298540325435
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse				803.556751793317
