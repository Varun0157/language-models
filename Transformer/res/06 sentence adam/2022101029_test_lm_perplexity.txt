holà mousqueton seats and order double the bottles do you know what we are eating here said athos at the end of ten minutes				1383.7051941140985
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided				665235.9013095667
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie				811302.0631810278
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him				46.84509662651479
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heaven s name				775.4476499700813
silence but you promised me whispered the poor mercer				15008.158320675397
d artagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired				9208.752415845267
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted				10278.260298554957
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and d artagnan was a gentleman				1341.6716297118137
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman				866.0806247963121
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine				113.05687021188942
you have not deceived me				48.797465975577055
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses				574901.1281103906
then m de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place				677.7544131622369
mazarin now understood that cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito				591882.437425662
he kept his word				655.1293936430035
ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare				576181.662398051
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin				78.75926726340752
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody				6564.530971107472
two hours passed away				438.08113662528143
cowardly court				2168.8233809848125
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty				808716.5578286098
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked				765098.6125273592
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme				375.9937730610347
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again				479.11096029000936
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o clock				1217.5165903628651
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror				1052.1058674311018
don t waste a charge				17347.96467594717
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family				2388.8293926787546
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly				5054.591565234809
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him				51.22603124634454
at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said edward dearest do you see that good man				122.48757845562851
again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness				745771.7261230132
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh				1507.5881357791836
two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners				777633.505941954
this was m morrel s wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened				6190.245692686163
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else				5244.637649000488
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees				2340.855393153467
but tell me what didn t he speak of me in any way ah				271.35718888534586
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know				1125.5817994184197
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dantès eagerly				1368.0267458452581
help cried d artagnan stop my horse has the staggers in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam				7268.86556139157
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word				698.835646780326
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents				67849.78512957253
now said the count let us follow him franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley				13365.639882197862
what a wrist you have reverend sir said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist silence				933.0938123489861
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success				2898.5483247107018
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest				7511.672397824055
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague on t				12362.08035619497
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him				44.603059185314635
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench you said madame danglars				103.84832917204834
that s all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos				17.596472063524335
what i can not tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope				1730.5241506112866
a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones				8355.210223487516
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords but it was too late				3654.129881224479
now then to breakfast said beauchamp for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert morrel muttered albert morrel who is he but before he had finished m de château renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took albert s hand				205.50001950378513
you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room was i pale albert yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself did your father speak of it inquired mercédès eagerly				1476.4061582501383
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated				569624.830265809
d artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them				105.59703556896112
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless				498491.99194649
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both				5872.662530182118
these would just have suited them				101.73483446991239
two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred francs repeated he				192.58454270017748
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe				702345.7557465668
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure				3169.744092070216
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan				589.1002104969706
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme				68.13752254624542
he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there				562.4365072164502
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket				7457.844805594638
as soon as possible m danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve				14317.620952549512
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majesty s wishes will be complied with do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will commence the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room				238.83725878465674
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver				6248.460361218753
good god added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that				621.2118060044634
well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good m mouston				117000.0340019176
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client				51093.64504126611
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves				31648.07106363704
two hours passed away				438.08113662528143
how pale you are				1603.281826491268
you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock				2019.6877982206133
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness				2762.9800737143064
thus d artagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means				1562.3407976382678
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race				7581.25121317055
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her				163.08097625978212
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks				1900.2981306052582
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his arm				1284.9424368937125
this smile appeared to d artagnan to be of bad augury				43055.04447779765
i had such a delightful dream				1228.4285849339474
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man				286.12787535379124
that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife				1171.4215401409917
what a disgrace to us oh never fear				2152.9554099686743
nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting paris as i told you as soon as possible				953.4622111028756
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example				1270.355182000114
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody				38908.34396875548
to him who is called the comte de la fere it is i said athos and what is the name of the person grimaud ah exclaimed athos turning pale				828.9805757650001
after the pope s death and his son s exile it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal s time but this was not the case				1854.2748911505826
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own				784.4424879021026
m bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it				71.93281204057828
danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like a century				14882.462220106554
a change indeed said albert				45.18865638089615
haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier				739389.6460923334
aramis went to cromwell s desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis				336.29552195766
she was branded athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand				198.67158926713003
go to blin or véronique for your clothes				4055.9626802877906
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side				941.5419662276277
adieu madame				713.836138832907
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman				573494.3504858795
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but i know he must be so at present we thought so too monsieur				630.3990040542247
you at least will be faithful to me arthur the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure				2199.1612108020977
at bottom the character of m bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice				616518.35629761
athos aramis and d artagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender				68019.52838910627
it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death				888.3618243646553
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son				961.9131259572645
charles smiled				528.0496489732825
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins				701403.2974174222
you are the son of the marchese cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari				36924.41503809222
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man				265.18486055879157
descend my lord said the man in the moat				7169.178198978882
go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify				697363.3869819524
see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld				31359.945706470167
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure				3339.1163812108593
m de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing				630.7011771103063
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale				965.5817138149212
now said felton we are safe milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted				2472.3759132626305
they will believe he is arrested and that will give him time in three days i will tell them who i am and they can not fail to let me go bravo athos				94.52247734726446
but that is not all madame				783.9092720161124
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company can t do without me there				404.0460028540299
a paper may be lost you are right only let me know where to find you that i may not run needlessly about the neighborhood that s correct wait do you want a map oh i know this country marvelously you				126.28846404268846
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair				43694.042345168695
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent when he is absent i am there but when you leave him for instance oh				1206.910989650268
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers d artagnan felt completely solitary				1074915.4152491016
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him				59.46447787036735
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica				12225.715551894014
but the voyage was not ended				9447.688170134696
are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth				2081.90557402738
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg™ license when you share it without charge with others				1443.4367496453892
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan				443.7264052151263
i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence				2558.717483247014
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood				4207.209587579861
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans				724666.864455355
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said tréville				1078.8934542880727
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril				492364.04369398206
what undertaking can have brought him to paris				577.7404159797069
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday				4310.752984183532
i have distrusted god i could the more easily distrust you				95.97437147423489
well have you tied the knot inquired the grave digger who was looking on				804.8233453360451
villefort s first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words				1051.2909480418239
how should he have been otherwise				5054.591565234809
it is in london they must be found what are your eminence s orders not a word of what has passed				1850.1794446219928
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugénie				503.787292588119
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis				11.499410690118284
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you				88.60143248766721
from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur				695546.8246778902
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it				135.9298493293792
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel				1903.1555010148825
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them				138.55412764791134
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered				816729.9758162788
that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days and me too said d artagnan				1.5109913369691284
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells yes sir a rope ladder and tools and have you them yet no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left what is it asked the count impatiently				2729.685085750349
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal				7918.215007316366
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance				2588.81711231172
so much the better said d artagnan				1.1426017217789566
alas he said i am then to die				1469.7002948379356
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine				793601.9042806176
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures				731806.2725320522
he has such a short neck said she				38.49016616368551
i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mother s and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals				796282.5999476383
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother				1946.4879319565384
the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte d aix				793425.5806748546
teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent				2164.0971847609208

now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence				1913.8046938984533

was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senator s robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him				43.00887207176523

to the smaller i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen well what has happened to them they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king s service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis				274.4304703391894

only d artagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that man s hat upon which is written the name of the village of ah said d artagnan i comprehend				5410.062530955101
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme				432.35345262463903
how happy i am at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up				1147.8837144432703
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more				979.3083354763487
you will put yourself at the head of the first				1671.4452314398673
and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown				32461.335560994492
albert entered				417.6836114574858
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him				59.03321221754777
it is then a service which you propose to render us count asked anne of austria after a moment s silence				963.7431467646113
what s the knot for thought dantès				135.68208784537654
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress				693226.41256902
i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville				21719.99658769026
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by château renaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel				803.2338080048669
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said				491.22710997143497
d avrigny m d avrigny cried she in a stifled voice				469.33940253522815
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual				4587.486244556282
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe				29827.026892255217
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir				239.51344712156373
on guard but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the pré aux clercs what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely				6751.784391797435
d artagnan pursued his way				757.9161775860019
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue				413016.94348306465
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life				731.095034189715
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all				413.7620152024827
you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse				179.3204900485839
keep your journey a secret do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done return with all speed enter marseilles at night and your house by the back door and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive for this time i swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies				1335.3987892297025
that is a serious thing monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said				429.5542122902722
he called porthos to look at it				58.81259773210384
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs				1040.9324342662862
are you ill sir i am very hungry replied mouston				1011614.2076798442
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated				662692.9498461805
this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellow creature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption ah said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably				815741.3787251632
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys				32446.819720311778
the will was never wanting to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall tis true i said so and i say it again and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves that is true we should need clothes and arms well said d artagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better bah said porthos looking around				2328.350561578964
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study				3399.555981288265
something better still mouston an expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies				725925.7516979608
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat				3970.4224137533693
lord de winter was not at home and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening				799.6884556434502
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint				8854.003018608428
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes				579262.6165179333
what do you mean by that				531.2887974073334
it was time				415.8501320733112
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime				3483.381713693652
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph f this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose				2179.06098575787
did you not observe his despair on the journey				1725.5365481659596
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this				1509.4562080886162
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea				835.5568530731601
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject				1563.164219823305
in the course of his morning s walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him				44.94888782602613
give me my felt hat bernouin the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim				30650.588524722898
if he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks i shall soon re establish my business and don t forget said d artagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen and now said athos while they bring the wine tell me d artagnan what has become of the others come d artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee and aramis at a table between two theologians				696372.4908315124
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious				699478.1447462059
i am called said andrea				331.27882613646983
but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going into normandy if you like delightful shall we be quite retired				1476.242838050543
i had no doubt he would return the following night				928.0455063371869
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life				862.7954252650693
i really must pray you to excuse me but in truth i was not attending to the conversation marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on one s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said				225.39787721074404
d artagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting				712134.9581081717
the count does not know how should i know				792.9984795718053
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly				5304.870976686365
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday evening he turned towards porthos and aramis				550.5547671330702
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling				186.06838604916814
the bearer of this letter will tell you madame what i dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit				557462.0306066587
he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered				36860.83837797092
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use				6551.8096097678335
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after				4374.17998828695
they opened it and found francs in bank scrip				788502.1374158154
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea				313.15443523640715
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk				11830.261498284422
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris				499.5689337262346
the road is never very safe during fair time oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle				637336.5792512726
yes he said				182.16209578551656
for ever and ever cried the youth oh				643.8789227174187
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity				774730.3477844443
now said he will you come i am ready milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window				616.7602892168843
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me				86.77469180377136
are you come to fetch me asked he				7.593745249286401
on his wife s request m de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure				1823.8164635377382
oh my heart				395.31198673164727
the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable				635089.2169959208
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune				1393.7493508775153
be clear short and precise as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which i formed one went yesterday to saint germain to impose on you				152.82085567251463
a nurse of the doctor s choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven o clock when valentine was asleep				3403.922608468545
alone asked athos				9.214824194961347
it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise aramis awoke				8503.612767655493
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours				8634.37907513536
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan				17248.71909021139
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais				23030.45685951868
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress and you aramis asked athos				31.925821886356054
m de tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to him				45.12581335917035
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only the deputies bowed and left the room				251.1999935009236
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs				46381.9264362986
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven				1027.7171992996443
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton ah sir				328.24531924549814
he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless				783846.1780481179
he was a strong minded upright young man				208.69835474965848
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo				760848.5465764422
in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage				2261.725173137675
but you only asked francs for a fowl we have a fixed price for all our provisions				7146.310592500691
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over here my lords				800064.2219646298
never planchet				278.29485548544517
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady				1339.1399363828239
good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow voice				499.36077891527856
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss				715646.6170220785
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul				1144.191743522307
when you come to paris i will return all this i will not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit				2139.738515299868
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars				103.65355676522967
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay him the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey				6848.482274930708
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name				774.3974973739273
lord de winter on quitting d artagnan gave him his sister s address				12898.332091310496
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise				1313.475350667816
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am				2341.4403586116596
great people only thank you for doing the impossible what s possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right				1188.4539897180528
and you go into that house cried he briskly				76947.10876632083
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent				2401.331531907086
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window				587.2082708158281
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted				11184.431244257532
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything do you then really suffer asked morrel quickly				1702.8558733554755
d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it				98.31773066218659
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason				3372.698345815032
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv				1374.61408682464
she found milady with a smiling countenance				2355.535822774
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study				2711.4533425846203
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey				1727.7900218007762
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles				46803.337482460345
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la râpée never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her				118.88257644134288
your friend albert de morcerf				668.3625977357761
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely				614811.530236573
has morrel whom we know been killed				4006.790595537628
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother				922.8731199897898
well eagerly demanded all his three friends				524.1794799127471
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own				795.3687376726195
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinal s suite turned back				1061.6634392492076
they won t devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos				20.720437638377636
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round				3460.6439941044514
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him				44.27442430110849
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto				6063.364150082358
moreover d artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character				3122.4921211626497
who i cried milady i a protestant				713178.2088217718
gracious heaven we are hesitating cried d artagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do i do not hesitate you know said grimaud				123.85054846799831
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage				2816.466202278966
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall				896.2878678484317
the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross				19489.166407132445
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long night				874.0508223456214
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them				109.06204523210175
a large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her				138.1673133512235
on the way we escaped				17997.067304373002
impossible morrel started				1095.6714159896273
he feared then to see her too often				13423.723915357932
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells				681008.2687802585
yes replied the old man				94.3829479042381
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemy s entire army				2184.229141240577
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears				769207.3474564143
ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey				33456.972191055145
to his friends m de villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the law made man				236.8355973992624
it was dark and silent as the tomb				3651.799260253823
take advantage of all and live happily and long				1653.997201905379
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at estrée sometimes at jarrie the cardinal s quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment				732188.8243427114
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human				36314.01347880723
milady was there as it were where you sit athos changed color				6786.825920821484
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration				632742.3596583763
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd				3424.9482086786684
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises charles had heard and understood it all				259.9862879552676
d artagnan s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him				60.31718195734119
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone				14162.858517861603
go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior				5271.409697706092
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated i have assassinated then and not executed				4332.679368862091
all at once he started				959.9707624497192
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door				219.59179879995594
well read it he demands your head my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two men				421.5267855859536
nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers				1148.734069414045

you pretend to pardon me and you poison me i cried d artagnan				1.8908698838630862
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing m				321.3451482801537
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				20499.11155817047
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties				567805.7256744348
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard				5052.678215103363
call madame de villefort wake madame de villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave				4100.029418027883
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured d artagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence				626588.5280746507
try and make an effort to do so my good man said d avrigny				393.34031495821176
you will go to london continued the cardinal				359.0583249711918
well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament with which you are at war is it not so				415.4331332473964
the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden				2505.7408584761597
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice but how pale you are				2046.3952032397888
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham				1898.9982748653963
are you armed he asked				769.0462711992427
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it				94.40869444496435
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming				3105.7895777584636
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his mother				811.8302196902081
you don t love me				48.84178921230666
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half				7047.981346647476
i can t see				870.8263237485281
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same				1193.711517616993
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders				1107.3489896558513
that s love or i don t know what love is come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so				259.02629672903475
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her				234.44075484379502
do you understand that my dear franz no horses he said but can t we have post horses they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting what are we to say to this asked franz				305.18908337084514
let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door				215.11092632679458
admirable and dogmatic repeated the curate who about as strong as d artagnan with respect to latin carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him and repeated his words like an echo				55091.24775082378
from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter				721.6082563653212
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter				845.886386391216
come raoul he said let us follow this man the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst athos and raoul descended				8896.255140233847
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercédès with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched say mercédès he said once for all is this your final determination i love edmond dantès the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband and you will always love him as long as i live fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said but if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too if he has forgotten you mercédès called a joyous voice from without mercédès ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him				47.38624130397
mazarin bowed				987.3822028290627
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume				2244.76000684644
none for a moment dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada				705295.0721274546
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers				8262.201636811138
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore				4833.738913299059
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard				1386.4103842486368
but we have not done with the thing yet do you indeed think so inquired the marquise				2189.65803837434
you alarm me				49.36899076383661
the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence and let us admit it the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak				2028.5181016599859
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance				25830.599861266724
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine				1397.4567120588526
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two o clock she had not returned				1158.832314701326
let us speak frankly continued louvieres and act in a straightforward manner				801.3810223770411
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth certainly agreeable undeniably witty he has unfortunately too much wit well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man because he is an enemy of whom of the cardinal what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man				159.85092116669145
one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might				10945.951963709938
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world your valise is then empty asked porthos with simplicity				1021032.2586223941
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied				5441.497086141919
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer				1810.3406196187227
in truth madame do you think that can be possible indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad				1335.3121916217876
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now no father stammered villefort at least i hope not and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care oh rely on me said villefort				343.5507912910761
and what will that signify to me				61.84604143838619
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience				6247.435497936093
well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work to day this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result				4904.402573365077
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light				2422.7298553140095
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven				1240.7120684019994
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form the fact is hazarded d artagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis				282.1845912511188
the count took out his watch				1589.8851272523916
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england				1155.5171991614513
for the last time will you come cried milady				46.95931316495854
i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses				1095.4614084668692
i would as willingly accuse myself				1387.4209008960227
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them				103.48786555075134
the general depended much on it he even came to force m danglars				323.8962227618928
he knew that i should arrive today at ten o clock he was waiting for me at nine at the barrière de fontainebleau				658018.2299659252
there is here no question of crime or treason				6077.634717225581
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville				1736.8921864081296
come hither i say and don t be afraid continued athos				66.88401596807796
i will make verses said he				5.445639293916242
no replied noirtier eagerly				3614.3006425655003
my uncle answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my family cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed				37101.6832355895
she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband				2194.688065810829
eh eh eh stammered caderousse				135.18849901540153
one day he had the imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal				455.81651067363185
then turning towards albert it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydée speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor				3556.8954244339175
i have not said good morning to you monsieur d artagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you				79.40302885248242
ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then meaning to say replied dantès with a smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a captain eh eh said caderousse shaking his head				336.8508192876555
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				67541.5779748375
my wife and my daughter would die of it				113.7986649352821
morrel said not a word				794.5783706777976
you are there sir he said respectfully				71883.6492079497
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed				936.2635532266894
how soft and perfumed was the air how lovely the blue heavens and star enameled sky				30041.245795290975
six o clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven o clock dinner was ready and served up				1073.8891454586344
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him				43.29254014510085
d avrigny cried villefort or rather i will go for him myself he flew from the apartment and morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door				257.07378279806596
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see d artagnan				10.155641904169887
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face				626.2796049099727
at this precise time the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door				213.32123339861346
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly				531041.9009732581
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries				678832.1649023053
what s the matter				963.1886312617112
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d artagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window				620.1256407510748
let us drink then she is dead stammered d artagnan				1.11275482249796
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady				1273.727027417425
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m de tréville s surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground				1402.2767860486583
prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be				1225.9176567683012
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o clock				1289.6824917959452
it was caesar s commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions				719867.271094141
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself				220.99950409718258
the count watched him				42.793788167454245
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns				605409.0764663902
noirtier wishes to speak yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance				2055.577503190238
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbé s dead body				1250.199248126519
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker his banker				3881.9445963759235
where is providence my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal him my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart				198.60045677330316
i am just setting out for blois				14460.980883770344
at that moment he cut it				58.587722991698634
i speak to you in french said d artagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language				3570.1084673531554
but you guess it now do you not or rather you remember it				58.61904851978051
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news				2955.5282148572182
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers				1158.9914670298385
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray				24552.80891994719
you never come to me without conferring pleasure				1961.4869091618289
you did not see her				140.18114326987205
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you				152.05661088498928
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs				47055.129660326835
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a cry				2573.0214068516416
d artagnan translated this for the others				1541.0562121713124
and another i carry all my effects with me				85.06317231121162
during this time porthos played close				5427.519214817712
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep				3510.33394707922
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute				39623.56056006811
well my dear friend win it it is at the point of your sword				1093.2295654600468

this army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcher it matters little colonel harrison				7264.277939379455
what is the matter				963.1900091150859
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply				1071.1694057205673
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which				978036.7607707835
that s his province ay ay said porthos pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin well so be it said d artagnan				1.72202064839838
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances				24100.198526421405
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand				206.09253595779836
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open				2166.3365813333635
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue				2907.503163772726
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascon s eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd				3605.0301428026014
the window yielded				9937.673431727138
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris ah really to paris				535.5103894701011
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against sleepiness				733965.979115054
you can not imagine mother how beautiful i think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love				1045.0199827537815
he is really king of paris he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers ah				438.15446433238566
he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second				2901.821686479182
well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man ali made a sign in the affirmative				4189.9320535482075
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence				1118.970661809439
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us amen responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea				2181.6352108327715
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard				677971.0423768937
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal				554064.6308415323
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs then sell out sell out marquis or you will lose it all but how can i sell out here you have a broker have you not yes then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price				6777.014356322796
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances				7060.501125370495
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire oh that goes for nothing said gaetano				3315.337339956131
i have arrived from cadiz this morning				708.25839406435
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini				9338.60778160599
at precisely six o clock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah				52083.591716142255
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitor s cross that lesser criminals were executed				2578.3369660301873
you perceive then that he is not happy said the count				115.85322686488564
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir				267.7342562411199
athos repeated m de tréville himself				177.13215551009975
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought				2889.565951097037
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are				2141.46046542342
come here grimaud said athos				8.87908415295068
athos s idea cried aramis and d artagnan at the same time				437.6848363801618
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so there was a moment s silence during which the noise of the banker s pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling				10954.462952545366

i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before				708.2425212179813
i can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest				2284.9139694685255

the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place				734.3618453523893
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres				9448.760423066376
it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel				4808.854879257531
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis				15.286680264453024

you are not a priest you are a musketeer a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me				54.49980254879982
yes my prince but listen				3031.9639780122493
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood				6221.114949477822
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it				97.94834337906653
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow				2529.62632650401

yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning				2631.4514910410435
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortune upon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be				1242.943287422645
it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave				848216.5977344664
what is your name i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat				673444.1144445575
everything was in the same state				6214.704770374662
who has told me this fine story monsieur				828.1437768394836
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign where is the treaty here it is anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d artagnan presented to her				144.2885493075186
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali				4168.652534132447
is our little neighbor worse asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth				3371.730331566207
they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain				1439.1489253098848
good answered grimaud and he went right to the prisoner				1007.2575406453402

the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had witnessed				46041.260618810724
poor edward is as much m noirtier s grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m franz m noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more				976.8728484767192
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him				57.3564835027412
what do you mean grimaud he exclaimed				2551.7906555831905
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house				381.00806733541384
in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again speak on madame speak on queen said buckingham the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words				950.756819798293
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here				552.0900496420707
the young man knelt down				813.8639332146909
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds				35422.39632417071
locusta valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent				1469.7227208558163
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared				36729.704550834525

the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square				4065.7762161439014
and kill him said porthos				13.800766715361535
certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop				3553.457477503647
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point				2385.0870235130756
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations				770802.3199723222
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully				6938.930897264701
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced				1653.747995486293
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed				1617.8016641224438
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nut shell				44822.02561579667

you are right sir and no one can doubt my position these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray				652.7128387709256
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention				707.1117373950915
let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame				3093.985154145261

unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition				686523.6162470618
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan				64.96632982513123
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps				696303.4265503878
dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word and so in fact he is said the owner				89535.24440829344
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips				470.2228941958529
but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment				774803.4964405572
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me				51.30058619707874

under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french				2160.9067722834534

i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers good day sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything				591.305216563206
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglars so be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned				41551.28012225121
andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues				34866.838078072826
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome				8728.846452068852
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered				678.4991020382969

ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received				3743.5973133249136

then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore				4316.010114747108
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to d artagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak				1753.7706916606526

but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				1583.9284224147407
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband				2357.459538272452

he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy				23941.309383476095
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense				7363.840843354647
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier				4019.2056761512495
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns				799362.5691738673
beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in puddles of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole left hand corner of the cellar and a tun the cock of which was left running was yielding by this means the last drop of its blood				1759.9280085865298

never exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never				3495.95491069722

let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment				686.3893459356062

i should injure the queen instead of serving her well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously				780876.6320602173
ah monsieur cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble				3249.396468143237

what i do care for now is to make my way into the jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their door				210.44193786645803

i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal				65778.57482545271
adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away				453.63477057150436
even his breathing seemed to be arrested				2282.8066975913057
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal				320.0064220354335

impossible go on go on my dear fellow said d artagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each you are laughing at me and want to try me said d artagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the iliad				748066.8120218285
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur d artagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted				233342.78331596364
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry out				210.26981364148364

planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side				937.908808521327
i am quite ready said d artagnan but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing and what is that asked milady				67.285662929277
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister				672228.7977661369
for three months i watched m de villefort for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him				58.06751627039339
he had now leisure to look to his wound				3524.7687636698033
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness				5170.51638851129
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast				937.9964696527697
do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor do not exaggerate the service i have the happiness to render your majesty				3204.683529796424
a year after madame well i wanted to see the good curé again				640.6121978346807
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembers and behold a proof as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours what for me only cried caderousse ah sir do not jest with me this diamond was to have been shared among his friends				477.07198379017007
but said d artagnan shall we not pursue that woman later said athos				13.256381956295977
at one of the doors that by which he had entered i placed our scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again				463.944431690397
dantès instantly turned to meet him				46.13584402900589
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied				35930.15518161403
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterred no				384.24068872150144
laporte entered				449.9655002419147
stop but it is very strange oh my god my head swims				857644.013199608
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis				18.118280414608122
made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont				720346.6208310429
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way				595.7499622130192
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see				1141.93630500484
au revoir then that is all i have to say today				3858.2680534828078
monsieur said he as long as i hold him in this manner he can t cry i ll be bound but as soon as i let go he will howl again				502.08865258799136
who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed				820126.768383054

the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited				5473.709351407857
that shoots me said the swiss				9136.723363416559
d artagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance				2352.032900888776
ah sir replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life this is terrible said athos				22.912779088215892
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count				109.16157587132669
was it not agreed asked the count that not only my person but also that of my friends should be respected by you and how have i broken that treaty your excellency you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf				1173.365883896624
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime				628350.2207175919
come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly				886311.0720382486
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos				1202.1953710492462
peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales				560116.4151102869
who s there cried caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands				540.1746582865924
embrace also our good and brave porthos				143.67778179040624
de château renaud m debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name				774.0268475563134
i knight you monsieur le comte then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king				394.17226871266206
well then off to the nearest goldsmith s and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him				53.039651324464785
he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air				823.0932003625458
but you don t know us when we can t have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host				991.3667712451247
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so so much the better for him he will suffer less said the inspector				1501.0004317773482
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria				688887.9435773008
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us				501.56317345996183
you never knew her eh madame who knows said athos				9.297498523686517

here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs				1032.8727114903356
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber				788.8852857108111
héloïse he repeated				3738.3956188661523
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word				739.4858326102158
debray maximilian morrel and m de château renaud did they speak of me not a word so much the worse why so				239.642423696721
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart				165.55879070936464
the two friends repaired to athos s and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them				105.51363427955995
i once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us				544.9174875199419
yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity				811950.6979683219

as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter				463.65847470683605
on guard milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy				731009.6990483839
i come for your commands my lord he said				239.47404828792085
and you have succeeded exclaimed d avrigny				558.6384006674218
bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between leu and dompierre the duc d angoulême on the east from dompierre to perigny and m de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin				15830.05039858674
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice				485.8172383794527
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos he can he says only swim in rivers when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere				639496.7470978094
impossible the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently				564201.6057002043
he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil oh do you then know him cried julie whose eyes sparkled with joy				646.1946713272357
do you understand the meaning of my words				791.5138157281312
the curate related the incident to the count of san felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month				6574.674427239376
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him				50.516672897945526
here it is said he				5.554979531509591
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still				6671.06846987946
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within				4639.154668307111
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon				2518.0166468295506
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation				2408.948971271301
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate				5567.898794159099
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction				7060.083665760131
milady seized the occasion				2471.2939008913463
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within				3873.3208668579578
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn				858.3562198071527
save me				55.90058409882606
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me				77.94130766218922
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot				1789.224770488161
he struck thrice				92701.01888825142
he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms				484.28147700189453
from the time d artagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels				20673.172041948277
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden				3683.3866964019835
but what happened after my departure how can i tell said kitty				1126.1020005205148
it seems a likely story to me and to me too besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain				1457.9452542558645
i learned it since i have been in prison and that from the conversation of monsieur the commissary an amiable man the cardinal repressed another smile				384.4624491783152
release broussel she cried never at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door				232.91577744577222
simply this said the coadjutor				4533.339977396943
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his father s residence or in his cabin on board the pharaon the abbé shrugged his shoulders				1249.078408779282
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it				80.46237841148542
repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name				1972.1540239685678
the matter is gallant				801133.9003835965
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino				2389.9903999097132
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others m de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree				689236.2282011585
d artagnan dressed himself and athos did the same				1219.6235115130444
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget people s faces but also the conditions you make with them what conditions have i forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it				68.8325714644664
i have touched the hand of the great man cried bonacieux				740.4865232997145
d artagnan was the youngest of all these men				401.6912143863142
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory				700177.5881274913
excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously				876038.7028094877
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens				679246.6176429013
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition				13583.836805850668
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way				704.0353013333763
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly				5621.960096422714
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier				3890.476217129511
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me shall you not go with the queen no replied mazarin				171.76384655292398
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling				4219.601759181945
now said d artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it i hope the accident has been of no consequence they don t yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper				2670.5339747016756
she prevailed upon him to leave the country but to leave the country to fly together to reach another part of france where they might live at ease because unknown money was necessary				5070.354811394601
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known no for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were				2507.4715702482204
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present fatigue all together exalted his mind above human feeling				3419.295672426221
good bye i must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again				291.29775880130836
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone				1017.327517734243
in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation				709173.2710337322
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty				2060.1138537833945
the penalty of death i greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him				51.19157708186347
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking nevertheless or find some one else continued d artagnan turning his back				1221.1801819391128
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber above as he supposed the bedroom of athos				693.5854229392602
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman				3221.2512140520057
i can see nobody said d artagnan				1.165781739224241
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office				4143.997891057171
a saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter				39121.99040944246
a moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow				1126.510706768664
and the other one demanded the count				145.83825555619717
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave				685597.8123345125
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner really my dear m bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so				351.49014135851303
as we said before by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o clock to one at cours la reine				41398.52448829101
if we can not we will do without him				61.96798672059283
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse				853.4472965973173
yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer				48570.67822322157
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say yes sire you will accept his judgment undoubtedly and you will submit to the reparation he may require certainly la chesnaye said the king				262.97166267958124
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room				197.79034448348295
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal				772006.6092676206
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape				1925.7995733943826
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand				207.24435257581635
shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future				1838.5415939693914
but the queen pressed the child s hand				208.15759472158265
he followed him				40.622809901517236
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands				522.5142259858993
stay said d artagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged him				42.58739441915662
your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects				6347.603836683906

coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife				699572.8757168758
alas said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the king s face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth				768100.4489714915
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort				94.3552287126964
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends				483.3713404835857
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door				197.11884103580138
he was a foreigner an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller				10615.040193849758
see said the count how very ungrateful women are				3420.4371759866294
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles i not the same thing by any means				1564.9899626805816
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine				56503.3240719142
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty				2805.0738413635386
listen said he to him				82.76633089952507

i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so				419.9072347718329
morrel obeyed guided by valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly				3162.364719030817
isn t it reasonable yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous				5134.95858393804
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away				455.3609549994815
you have heard what i said				192.02674126279808
is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips				533.7065688554363
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose				4305.802008944699
my faith				1606.4231903235302
but what detains her				117.39411579317198
five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered				636.5265166796231
then d avrigny spoke				9294.94613173448
benedetto exclaimed an inspector				1679.3190221085745
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength				1621.9093238919693
italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head				336.3933546879201
ah m andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone how do you do charmingly as you see				995.4371921232947
it was then that the door of edward s room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared				48145.01518770141
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless				1584.2517135003332
the three young people were talking together				916.8237236139674
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me				123.6350026969204

he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him				60.78950181995409
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate				1779.6098894289055
ah there				725.255156448588
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you dearest valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet i can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you				69.28185376993727
you were going to drink my wine to the health of the king monsieur i was going to drink a small glass of it if fourreau had not told me i was called alas said fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror i wanted to get him out of the way that i might drink myself gentlemen said d artagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day i beg of you the two guardsmen courteously accepted d artagnan s excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired				1376.929834025441
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel floated at the foot of the crag				36650.24164463128
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm				4918.0133762445
be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing				2909.996989836711
short and stout who is it they all asked together in a low tone				1066.0301137654299

hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile				7797.179416295458
i faith said d artagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand				215.97158883135094

at each shot morrel turned pale				772.7243373201356
but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded				639630.9329310604
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here ah				300.9957363966934

oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him				62.96371289639608
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts				7992.946734294359

the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart				168.47609350011896

i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days				1808.1105249416596
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming				17066.049233733636
around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen				435.1041228395074
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well				443.2429848848403

ah here is one of them i believe in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared				900.4705684063675

lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her				140.0753698115955
he was an irishman one of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the duke of buckingham				1898.570920850806
serpent muttered d artagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read d artagnan the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt i hope sir said he you have no objection to make none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot				854927.1288680548

the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man s face				641.6785557136848

i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question				1342.486930152626
the king went straight to him				43.1162742401029
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling				3294.08919001214
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there				554.2566833546747

supper was served				8321.2077932288
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire after bowing to athos and d artagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted				706982.6781558528
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree				23678.005650813193
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persia s sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor				679979.6521402035
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal				2101.81405701656
had she one redeeming trait				949216.7486693285
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him				44.268713957064364
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself				2022.3109554984385
that is the least we owe her that s true said athos but that concerns aramis well replied the latter blushing what must i say oh that s simple enough replied athos				15.163610853091507
but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them				108.76031528949828
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter				2548.836787033589
so said charles he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere sire said aramis				18.35035016436279
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one below				3051.9054838786797
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo				23442.735541182527
but first interposed d artagnan you must present me to madame du vallon a third sigh from porthos				396.44535900434624
discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france				517.4509399558924
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch but will it not be lost oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up a gardener grimaud nodded				27405.687926060622
a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible				3650.9913801279868
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine				99.6284791621751
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment				1153.737759581145
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers				3031.567867543547
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				2258.697765935566
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder chapter xxvii				7030.567379147679
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel				1873.4621997811284
i am choking				778936.1197035242
athos raised his sword d artagnan lowered his				1059.1473723052773
at last as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and monte cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit				571750.6692827517
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together				1363.6124177151257
as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hiding place and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted jacopo jacopo jacopo then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies				53290.86069650873
perfectly said the dragoon				79042.38644486805
meantime d artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king				679.3427546259805
come let us speak of your little affairs				2356.8334841766905
yes my lord apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier d herblay now the abbé d herblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled				574.7889630095082
then listen said he				7.338344552208246
i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics				7015.497592094
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary				5104.180015994874
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads but observe cried d artagnan that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress beware d artagnan beware said aramis				548.4138490681852
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone				852.0160151623021
take them away juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to die juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open				2296.721121278341
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection never to anyone you understand me replied villefort affectionately when i say anyone pardon my urgency to anyone living i mean yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness never i swear to you were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning				1650.7879958298647
then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his valet de chambre patrick				4624.54674518951
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy some i shall displease others				1427.9187393795648
the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit				10166.530004832797
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur créquy another time at my own house in the country in my château at when i had a château a third time at monsieur de tréville s where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman				1633.0844141257214
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner				3063.5493617139996
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it				66.28243327037475
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy				46601.44309856223
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth and here we are at the ninth				702195.7345308296
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him yes yes cried both young men				549.7706389244427
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life				673.1085597484349
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid				8992.815769115823
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony				614337.9581075907
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated				555582.1483981344
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart				166.26360401540893
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven				76436.23559235531
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night				939.0803871852006
well sir he said				207.009290080655
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king				333.91560800462963
but he has wealth i believe already doubtless he has				735053.1283720471
i never was in a law court i am told it is so very amusing amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life				679.1241330999064
i have warned you				79.02033308675962
after whitsuntide it would be another thing there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction				7087.060423115004
we will return someday to pray over her grave d artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed aloud				2081.1442893876288
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her				172.16482140460727
since my brother s assassination in the streets of nîmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard				6925.11413790217
start start said d artagnan				1.1249610211145091
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave				643194.0682763284
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment why so				259.1745551779506
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary				3359.5366254363307
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of d artagnan				14.806566185452795
on their way they met grimaud				132.08274385796147
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret				8903.053524684427
in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared				569863.9045131434
not at all				281.4966385460557
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary				17440.029015703523
i heard the chevalier d herblay say so the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures				28739.326597575502
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven o clock she was at the fort of the point at eight o clock she had embarked and at nine the vessel which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne raised anchor and steered its course toward england				1300.1124893122421
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary i said the queen				214.2741274238009
rather place faith in what i tell you				73.71147609218733
i do not understand you so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze				7048.90224940031
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you				163.50611580986103
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still				4977.423446670915
whence have you these ideas of death you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live				3204.5062736850373
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm				21128.373168395665
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction he is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions				781355.6222850874
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him				47.423934318000526
the royal procession set out for paris				508.86390083204935
i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved				645831.5505434496
a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating				26297.2181076001
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly				17620.07989108619
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor woman s head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees				2305.5805023366643
yes the enemy				1339.5838033467046
the servant went out but returned almost immediately				1595.6496551948476
who sent you come come you are going on quickly m benedetto yes and to the point				2305.3265580517786
the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true worth				3268.797277054413
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell				3021.6242734843045
dantès was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones				4095.117376227023
one might believe the queen was about to speak				1506.9923069707575
but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe				12023.75997256545
what shall i say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men				483.99914001319553
the people who wrote are anglo germans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor				14635.573208114629
the three friends looked on panting and astonished				1488.1730821574017
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count				597.8592567041459
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable enough				1952.779851057024
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on earth will assist him in contriving mazarin s escape if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute				21560.54987652638

then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms				8122.441726115743
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise				56686.23837340947
