m d épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history				4533.227572213019

he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone				1349.200887831872

if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude				27890.463946615462
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of d artagnan				158.91597246471468
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead				651.6787932492058
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert				188.36873776883283
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis				181.11806868428351

you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask				6937.931729701716
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan what				641.9157310736347

your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself				925.1351567315959
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine				2020.494042154173
then he looked anxiously at valentine				672.6195895618929

franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred				10450.459283174921
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				434.2963481382749

when i say one spoonful i began by one now i take four				4739.509130701687
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch				1470.3248471741824

when i speak of ignominy you think i speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death				451.89164197993057

that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends				289.31270440331315
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered				4343.82933705258
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity				2008.5001873102453
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face				319.2277836864172
you allow me to give you this title continued the count in french it is necessary to excite this man s confidence you can speak before me said franz i am a friend of the count s good returned peppino				2476.5988728909088
d avrigny took the young man s arm and led him out of the room				93.16466463783925
i shall be happy to meet you again sir may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish murmured d artagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard				3382.81315402071
attend to yourself answer me dantès waited expecting a question but in vain				863.2810291131525
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer				1176.1123435003794
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect				5728.536736939689
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her				146.6359795534591
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy				18007.539988198056
yes buckingham the woman was english then no she was french but she had married in england the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door				192.47969971455433
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself				198.63928760070016
for added he the future can not fail to mend i inevitably look for better times				1797.0508911089044
what will it signify if one two or three more are added				8541.40650398147
this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world				1186.8541427685748
the company was then heard departing then the door of the closet in which d artagnan was was opened and mme				205.54509986852577
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose				1890.6894083423433
it was the way in which he spoke				6464.236728729639
where is athos in the cellar monsieur what you scoundrel				53407.472407107016
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters				2602.64015846752
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital				6372.356497721443
you understand athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger				56769.822960052494
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m villefort entered				959.732304461763
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive				33823.955077594466
was it the englishman who carried off crowns from here the other day no he really had crowns and we found them				76.34738415422783
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life then we are to have no more pistols no more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of itself my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me				65.75235204480711
and perhaps his saddle therewith no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos				73.82041101233769
they were making nearly ten knots an hour				1312.5606247907756
at ten o clock every one was in his appointed position at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day				295.15016607713864
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said				245.53825940008326

by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare				34923.278437095694
a propos add one thing what i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden				2528.7917600815103
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos				39.03955404155136
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing				27558.196673007344
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly				27565.398757101346
edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as la jeune amélie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn				8390.871868216722
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it				38.13932270855972
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman				12048.0825858154
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat				2187.013860641214
but proceed i beg of you				68.69335054357619
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels				29303.504033906756
you are questioning me like a king s attorney				5727.963134031818
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel				4192.953990715824
it is his way and you must take him as you find him at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act				985.5509987131913
what i hate to day i adore to morrow and vice versa				52704.67348994211
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect				7026.123454381071
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water				1303.2705833789755

this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young man				129.1003464050065
toward the town of louvres was the reply				661.3963582257926
the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of houdin and bethune				8910.919305404477
the surgeon declared that the situation of the musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood				1475.4440965694725
once sir when i was grafting a rose tree well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another ah that is another case i should be turned off and lose my pension three hundred francs a hundred crowns yes sir so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things not even for fifteen years wages				41811.3661937734
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination				49235.76889997078
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway				35488.53446790547
it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier				9917.034371029673
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night				526.8195609855403
on recognizing her step mother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed				322.7390250507289
it was that paper you read this morning read it again dantès and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this day of april be alexander vi and fearing that not he may desire to become my heir and re and bentivoglio who were poisoned my sole heir that i have bu and has visited with me that is in island of monte cristo all i poss jewels diamonds gems that i alone may amount to nearly two mil will find on raising the twentieth ro creek to the east in a right line				6242.932859086418

another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation				23709.77598076136
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château d if and the tower of planier				20940.133008772522
anybody may possess a five franc piece but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me				63.8323739552183
ah me				27.449085947251785
d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch				6059.103963585637
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back				1000.6330591326496
a family affair chapter xlix				16175.448507313742
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears				999.122147419124
i will begin again then order to conduct to the person named charlotte backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of france but liberated after chastisement				14940.96700681377
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor				889.9941974022055
come and i will explain to you and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went				3081.843493117996
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting				17573.326592906244
milady appeared to have entirely recovered				5149.219052133925
dantès easily recognized them faria had so often drawn them for him				30.840028027216146
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall				479.2793633578983
he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m morrel and strong in the multiplication table which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him				31.637830457528857
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table				669.6989667805813
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg				5194.239390402707
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been you are in error sir answered the queen				315.82250378295015
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman				1020.9435548979396
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation				4228.044762461517
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre				6240.777982720828
do you take any interest in politics a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan				178.49162873387363
although weakened the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty				2033.823748556888
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris				390.36213948703653
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high				20090.01205505529
two methods of self destruction were at his disposal				6061.548724870316
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check				38156.58902201749
they led me away masked				78000.9883014639
yes yours your own property sir my right hand correspondent is signalling let him signal sir you have distracted me i shall be fined that will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bank notes sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient never mind take these and the count placed the packet in the man s hands				381.30159160984743
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases ah if i were in your place said albert				421.4801562500002
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o clock struck				2971.055721174296
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis				192.01401408208505
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner				872.2476111745908
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said d artagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d artagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis				186.5933083806394
well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan				3.893412220575073
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it				51.35664707617526
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner you have seen him asked aramis in the same language				4156.362424694413
speak if you please said mazarin				251.7675595185529
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				5463.4770204176175
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness				7868.877492728186
she looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at d artagnan with an air which said you are very amiable no doubt but you would be charming if you would only depart d artagnan rose and took his hat milady gave him her hand to kiss				8196.872745210785
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand				161.56707901090738
in france he cried the usurper in france				714.0884076426856
i wish to speak with monsieur aramis				85.02740478296717
there he stopped breathless and panting				67949.50650004022
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable				7027.530728326165

yes said he				24.657114728815362
let them wait for me at the pomme de pin				52550.441113996676
in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee a sign from grimaud put him on the alert				3223.8973134145504
the beggar of st eustache				7174.417301182496

luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter				296.37558031936675
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter				621.8620458970225
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose				3650.340330978303
excuse me excuse you for what				471.3880358338097
ah said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that				595.9681723182217
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical				38071.24333625407
d artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could				2965.699724920044
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh				787.8665238830104
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their places three forward and one at the helm he resumed the conversation				736.1147892711733
do not forget this evening do not forget that promise be satisfied				1669.1482424613873
i am all attention madame said he				19.35419096244428
the devil cried the host at his wits end				1017.5303095607279
d artagnan glanced at the dinner service				1604.2966447994743
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there				530.9808274014453
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees				1117.7254766860326
there was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais				16283.870158018997
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion				1012.3548276169123
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin how far is mazingarbe two miles and a half thank you grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man				130.10730925146987
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris i had need of distraction well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said d artagnan				45.67560902056986
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet				53023.14377809413
you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy				2231.691333014442
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench you said madame danglars				350.0924324107321
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us				256.80130419699907
the door is opened to all who knock				104773.4843978368
there are the horses				997.173116898222
were her fears realized				101396.55889267934
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis				66325.15299688694
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes				2577.0193357784933
is it broken off yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor indeed				1030.1659703118933
at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible				40976.27500963219
and what he continued has been done with the poor body by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it				60.40606280920178
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas				1656.05300894525
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera				2179.4018231884475
but don t fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word				563.6763761420168
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation				6101.788500430403
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty				2375.563021144084
quite alone he asked				827.92108898026
to horse				950.6811123306184
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt				1926.6684743398932
what do you say inquired charles rising				9734.082930417797
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing				30217.295519954743
château renaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain do not pay any attention to him count live in the chaussée d antin that s the real centre of paris boulevard de l opéra said beauchamp the second floor a house with a balcony				13900.001698777827
yes i hope so at least				2555.7348789675416
he held a vial of salts in his hand				153.63662622793757
d artagnan monsieur well then athos porthos aramis and d artagnan forward cried athos				71.45444650842228
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated				8023.510940325827
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter				1102.7220942674614
one evening a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead				667.5656855023764

valentine rushed towards him his lips again moved				10395.649151609274
he weighed the two angers in his brain that of the cardinal and that of the queen that of the cardinal predominated enormously				38784.34855921528
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the âme damnée of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like a ninny as he is a ninny indeed said porthos but is the matter certain i had it from aramis replied the musketeer				774.5212098577671
d artagnan looked and was seized with pleasure				975.5852693286731

monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn				855.3058478064738
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds				32900.627994043316
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited				7444.790847325224
laugh then said monsieur de retz they are looking at us and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group				7893.4851192934
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away				532.1929700827303
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams				5621.890397108399
and morbleu why do you not go yourself				847.6646065278296
he was thunderstruck				23115.216062570256
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them				81.58933780880254
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				2133.8167015679387
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper				985.0581472291328
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence				981.5158549874719

it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten days				1700.8019790791247
it must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which d artagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this detention				76003.59197970593
be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing				3292.3649643727226
this is the abbé of whom i spoke said the doctor to d avrigny				908.2876355119123

what troubles me is the idea of defeat				50087.15423416674
m noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal				5928.207156633893
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is				4208.028177981873
what asked his friend				167.9729809403215
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping				37796.05108621259
dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone				904.0862995559108
he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her orders				3239.019476621228
then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break it				57.351287294636926
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it				38.7121383014169
by that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable she recognized one of those gloomy puritans she had so often met not only in the court of king james but in that of the king of france where in spite of the remembrance of the st bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge				5444.606434358669
on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor but cried morrel this purse is not yours julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning				692.5794193117214
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword				1146.4122771389711
i am her best friend upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here no they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen indeed				958.9262884357875
at half past six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times you think so my lord answered la ramee				573.4218322526984
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles				1210.4670532465173
what are his means of existence				1419.085142762979
there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu i don t even know their names yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence you think you were i am certain of it ah stay				11974.668102811958
you smile yes why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own				687.0616135143431
that s what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio				2043.809998984873
you may be easy then you ll get there d artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters				17360.46012672703
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended				2110.998392727823
what monseigneur said d artagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself				174.861430657298
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned				28091.042272708317
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers replied				5434.749842528209
toward two o clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door but as planchet awoke in an instant and cried who goes there somebody replied that he was mistaken and went away				533.334886806717
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie				68913.66313656037
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy				3967.7462677014037
to what end				1002.6787337968645
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the window				532.7185320425759
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day				297.6269437250605
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				32.838839880689484
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered				973.9909535723805

the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped				8255.247011540952
what do you say to this mother and albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book a note of francs				662.8439498629513
dear constance				17407.809158027707
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis				83.18204132483011
no no cried the countess you must not leave me				38.74660808247758

the pardon chapter				219.91275842030163
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti				1246.5757961723798
and then besides the useless blood				1493.7098476299388

i told you of it yesterday				4778.07116016105
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more is there indeed my good fellow				2126.126211632935

so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly				3614.893552091702
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mother s admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature				3522.883476951111

whither art thou going grimaud to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention				979.2336230298476
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count				156.55220760272204
no god forbid said the cardinal only at what hour was he with you oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later at what hour did he leave your hôtel at half past ten an hour after the event well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected that house is suspected tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it indeed sire i did not				428.6569824476453

from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it				53.150847007517456
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham				1784.9589006413878
you are a man of taste				12167.963709752621
adieu and a prosperous voyage				2427.003415248741
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present				3564.274143732124
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out				326.29868927061835

the sermon over the procurator s wife advanced toward the holy font				52171.03594863378
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at you at me yes albert reflected				3877.793049512374
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress and you aramis asked athos				91.53083857424161
the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence				7788.692161398154
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon				1778.5426907204653
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face				319.15944437093054
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining				40340.99674873665
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point				1385.8525348719209
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh				41306.00627871669
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words october it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse				2349.124313095975
but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos				148.56985335878463
they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are				848.1263263262667
d artagnan dressed himself and athos did the same				1011.0638702373876
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m noirtier that is it said the old man s eye				1990.5848656123353
mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little				1930.4821221611799
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champs élysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel				502.56339648186355
the inquiry m de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil				12394.248247448486
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead				908.4925174204946
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released him				25.907650149345265
absolution father				847.4471759043109
is it not true aramis said porthos turning toward another musketeer				820.6066691724973
what then well he is a man porthos looked at d artagnan in astonishment				1210.8607647078923
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of d artagnan				182.89624929215555
here we are said monte cristo it is only half past ten o clock come in certainly i will my carriage shall take you back no thank you i gave orders for my coupé to follow me there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage				519.7100723465941
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is i have gained francs by the sale of them				80.27566914685028
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing room				92.88162353044537
you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand				161.96911705725717
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate				2057.024751810702
what is this that m de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders				1144.7036243538525
say to her peace or war				3533.135320473784
now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn				38935.66348929424
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would fail				32950.460174531385
sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine s marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded noirtier s countenance remained immovable				2709.5986345606725
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister				7208.179945083871
pooh replied d artagnan				4.553894797647606
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune				1656.0703817238073
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha				14796.17845888761

bonacieux would have any suspicion				4680.509910711987
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle				20566.72716876182
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future				1725.5587639074568
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust				12106.904872946787
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns				88322.9131202564
a brute that cardinal				311.5598496724915
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship				34564.37096405773
ah this letter gives me an idea a capital idea				2369.8347912745517
the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her				149.96568393256246
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye				1960.6892520965735
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine o clock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation				24940.601063784456
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers d artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side				1115.6105112728499
but then you are rich very rich indeed continued debray taking out some papers from his pocket book which he spread upon the table				664.0090533830975
is he not peculiar he is more than that replied château renaud he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life				454.8308078701284
silence then cried athos				22.34039947558478
we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us				254.46434512990749
want one cried the gascon				1932.0494926826366
a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave				44671.2594924202
no monsieur le comte answered the servant i think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes				2569.753762450611
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress				49856.6381501996
don t you see them cried friquet don t you see				1367.8604128315797
what was your deputy called de villefort the abbé burst into a fit of laughter while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment				1245.0918348271068
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul i will blow your brains out with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos				181.59906183532829
do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not perfectly well my good friend and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons				5171.61118388735
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee				5755.434722710878
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket				78660.00353628484
presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remarked at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor				1881.6585718296421
i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner				1036.7526030729136
caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort oh my god my god said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed man s father in heaven and his judge on earth				1299.8211492460457
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action				2953.8840126507152
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will				705.7515260000727
non inutile desiderium oblatione go to the devil with your latin				57466.622470458344
they then determined to depart				4771.632295148134
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind				667.876119781031
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality				45947.3925303689
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning				1754.650661063364
i thought you had softened				10916.876630590616
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers				72352.43242958483
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor				61768.683254016774
bravery is always respected even in an enemy				878.0535448090161
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments				18876.635829328705

it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests				1948.8598909538125
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood				2539.8455014248498
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity				1771.8309980429603
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water				1301.3970232331578
to give your majesty s reply to those who await it stay marechal i will not appear to parley with rebels madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return anne of austria s eyes shot glances of fire				1666.1797461163874

in the meanwhile the promises of m de tréville went on prosperously				152498.17583311687
milady recognized his step				1914.0218986428035
it is an old man s caprice and is there no means of making him revoke his decision yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that m and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass				1108.223744622902
we must proceed in an orderly manner hush said grimaud he is coming out				385.92155256997256

it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i can not take off my doublet for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself that is true monsieur replied d artagnan and whether drawn by myself or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman				652.3761663999504
as to d artagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again return immediately to paris j				118122.18462238506
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him				29.922132756693685

you who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine				1940.331009747447
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then i was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory in what manner could these events concern you				74.03209182347959

cavalcanti said debray				1455.4300980988396
cocles remained in m morrel s service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant				2539.117738991178
you are the chevalier s prisoner raoul gave it up reluctantly aramis instantly seized and read it				49.13193916547696

all is over				2199.1989622302785
the cardinal s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence				51537.02160872253

and aramis i have seen him also said d artagnan but he seemed to me cold ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look				698.7196920815708
it was a pledge a remembrance				14662.717908809545
and pray what was this quarrel about these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose to do her violence without doubt said athos				193.6475682296141
a circle was formed around them				71.5489569150536
help help screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands				392.12923737069605
edmond found some solace in these ideas				6161.480147821863

they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette				8155.857510847022
andrea cavalcanti or rather m benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family				1229.9079342193988
i implored heaven that he might come				625.5665759538765
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword				1147.281783350605
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope i can not tell you that replied the inspector i can only promise to examine into your case oh i am free then i am saved who arrested you m				689.0462265880824
yes that first and other things afterward speak it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you me yes you				83.82169498467121
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me				70.70951932980086

the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more just				11268.959539199082
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike				14627.61955503452
i i detest i loathe it very fine anne				6527.8475952061635
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror				8439.738760144814
d artagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for				639.5665198601222
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics well listen my dear aramis said d artagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor				570.4508218842869
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face				319.5892054034329
in five minutes it will be too late mme				173.05216197442172
ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each				4028.86111664182
thanks monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you				70.14777951623142
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold				3378.154647185409
make free now you have begun no you are after all a good companion i will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold i shall not sell it do not fear not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man				130.9706558703045
i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert				14822.829389638728
the count de rochefort grimaud nodded the third time				290.5277355903773
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing				200532.7000562453
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role				98463.3212248715
about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand				157.19139240022807
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret				2132.847260467378
do you wish to see the powder room no				389.5172387577846
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger				1052.216243518287
be christians				126101.2736158304
d artagnan said athos taking his hand you know i love you if i had a son i could not love him better				986.0586725484457
my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us				255.36480690641636
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen				3324.411316378592
proceed said he to the host				914.5497377309784
would to heaven				501.4096536983978
there is myself replied milady				127.87042865997124
his itinerary was promptly determined he would go to dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward soissons the other toward compiegne there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained				12029.379993607772
the fact is said d artagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment				6720.614518141645
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				23902.092965105796
what then are you i am about to tell you wretched man oh mon dieu i am john francis de winter i do not know you said the executioner				1632.4654527645307
one of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i and monsieur de chavigny do i am sure why does he take my comb why do you take my lord s comb asked la ramee				526.0464108728072
they waited upwards of ten minutes				2641.0290001290823
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed				9134.97212612801
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture				2590.799153599384
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey				5306.763424741661
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate d artagnan drew up his request and m de tréville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers				30468.062426035347
he entered portsmouth about eight o clock in the morning				703.9060647724526
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way				506.3584683669993
on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced				46831.55539442225
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds				2167.8070246094403
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party				2246.498985289285
he was now as we have said three and thirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance				1933.5130282274845
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness				17457.101909548463
until then you will not see me				39.341036200765174
he is at my house come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us				254.691591378595
ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they haven t left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they haven t left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie very well sir said the host i ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain do as you like said raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place				463.25516171862114
oh if you know him tell me by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple that is he that is he but his name ah his name				516.8627999441558
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding				28037.888270168103
did you ask for me my good friend said m de tréville				1136.4509824396214
and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for morrel				502.12217174047856
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later mazarin coughed a little				1239.5731359431675
during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators				52461.460389513355
for the poison which she pours there is no antidote yes yes				924.7598237545891
this gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel				4210.131561814736
well my dear father in the shipwreck of life for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered				29422.99256654431
good thought d artagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend				268.67808840449266
so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness has anyone besides me seen madame de saint méran no has anything been sent for from a chemist s that i have not examined nothing had madame de saint méran any enemies not to my knowledge would her death affect anyone s interest it could not indeed my daughter is her only heiress valentine alone				873.600815925577
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years ah yes i understand said mazarin want of fortune perhaps				4679.992152228961
this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions the public astonishment had reached its height				20615.859889677195
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast				21051.059955358553
as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes				383.5999527087513
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly				714040.466703834
age has warmed not chilled your blood				1623.3353019470867
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze				63712.11261114308
put it up again my friend said d artagnan				4.1127197681132435
i have returned guitant				22732.033594102104
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered				25205.850985855213
he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would				127336.09231909072
well do you not adopt this means athos said d artagnan				4.295079475237564
but you come from england				856.5702748159237
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling the baroness became pale				830.3181249011221
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death				442.9091701830973
groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice				5800.990061010473
what is that line				6655.594908238221
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for l evêque of latude from the bastille				4902.765825571994
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved				37889.414944103744
albert looked around him				25.073177728631556
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation you see cried d artagnan				33.218852506514146
morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon				2680.605214861166
she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night				524.6513445253703
i go to morrow my friend replied d artagnan				3.86366426629692
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently				49763.77037416407
bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor and those of the first floor you know they are never closed				3625.140022210161
they then dressed themselves				2495.750538462431
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band				20044.46456334085
he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me and he told you nothing not a word nothing that would lead you to suppose nothing and yet you spoke of him at once ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the count s aid monsieur is quite right				1171.569013835181
it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own				701.473134738357
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme				172.20201426806045
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed planchet				926.8797390720715
i am of d artagnan s opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat				2125.900142688929
yes said they we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england				759.8133819698654
the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life no no cried dantès you are mistaken you will not die				1002.2633383854217
besides what does the gospel say				727.2061743567017
so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this				1017.9753318202987
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage				2509.762296477688
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light				1159.6907804210687

i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses				989.4687267948054

but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation				25536.945044173273

the others are on the mantle piece of your excellency s bedroom good what o clock is it four o clock monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerf s and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way				515.2664880524399
all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately				1650.1080322106593
how could i pronounce that word				504.7637894429699
you have forgotten it porthos said he				18.936279200784885
perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos				71.8485514454973
luigi was jealous				31018.66143296783
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest				14904.15075292232
in god s name answer me he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering				73843.37226925895
is that your opinion d herblay yes said aramis we have promised then continued athos we have another reason it is this listen in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry				148444.24414528278
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody they are firing at the corpses replied athos				46.53213753859692
médéah was standing at the rack eating his hay				103997.10086029102
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion				1011.3396763834122
however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken				1688.8260496404512
the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos				142.71256833400804
nineteen returned dantès				378.52754094227754
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing				1461.343186244182
chapter xxxi				30164.461726186
albert bathed took his supper and went to bed				332.4140151452392
the promise volume four chapter				280.9822103446772
aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword				1147.1198630686672
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step				2097.8059846587503
shall i knock hush replied d artagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window do you hear nothing whispered planchet				705.0781173173873
thus all my opinions i will not say public but private are confined to these three sentiments i love my father i respect m morrel and i adore mercédès				3079.02620870932
no sentinels no one at any of the windows				2036.4817736405596
i shall perhaps have something to say to you and he went out				339.48144140268005
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers their names asked the monk				7976.027099198683
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase				446.9686767445351
d artagnan said athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her shoulder how can i tell said d artagnan				60.29509718967779
neither of them had returned				1556.9170790026276
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity and what do you mean to do to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours and what is your excellency s project just this				1010.7977789803102
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				7427.21805293372
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim				120660.4939640652
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them				77.59784155709238
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter				4066.4974814140296
i never go there why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing				3503.7986024615298
the blood had mounted to the head of d artagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis				186.6890696392268
who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money				1006.5757485860493
do you understand the meaning of my words				528.425962778196
m coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme				210.25607785907133
you have suffered a great deal sir said franz inquiringly				12834.844473148585
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission				10582.543656312297
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title				8714.972262939425
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth				1235.1797989329891
besides d artagnan passed the evening with me well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with a brow flushed with anger				1241.6590177755372
but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror				563.8895604455531
do not forget your crosses				218490.42912551554
i wretch				5628.6820951088075
these would just have suited them				72.85524736632141
you are right father i understand you then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for me thanks morrel caught his hand				157.26261549287705
that s well said athos let us go home and read it the note burned the hand of d artagnan				175.31510741588423
at your service sir said planchet overwhelmed with joy if i were still capable of serving you perhaps so replied d artagnan				34.31715059341875
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man				84.99635357698502
he must now get his bearings				93739.20133176979
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband				1646.9605592020769
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand				75201.48478861467
i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child				1058.2644241409732
it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation				723.9363292072373
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian				1433.5662417824265
you are right said the latter m				462.35345416283155
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request noirtier made a sign that they did				2204.7397079894686
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look				722.0877324448975
the next morning d artagnan ran to find athos				81.8807483836517
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door				190.37980552522538
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning				695.755404982221
but peppino did not answer				1050.468144484041
this time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape				1068.0205283112036
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos for i madame i may say i was your victim when wounded dying i was abandoned by the surgeons				78241.7797302626
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel				282.9532788714625
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence				28927.547743748044
during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife				897.9108279379246
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra				68556.73876656556
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation				76405.77143997462

there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often wish for what is impossible what is that to find such a wife as my father found monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols				6327.501638338623
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return				2631.270809809777
your song is as dismal as a de profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton				1128.6145844810444
the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at rouen after which if nothing new occurs i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisy le sec and i said athos am returning to bragelonne				8844.188282064457
richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can and he left the chamber without once looking behind him				28.779532003470468
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own				693.249815949401
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were				2025.7110853641184
here he said take this pocket book do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison				1906.4861972515293
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir				196870.59134471486
père pamphile more wine and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table				671.0220092492478
impossible the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently				94458.46103240411
athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers				1059.593922502134
do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love true replied franz				323.4483311461033
let him find it out if he can				16180.709666180588
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life				464.5988366755511
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded				1980.1333989554003
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard no to be sure replied d artagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him groslow s face brightened				8339.869699787803
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc d angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general				4078.5568720961764

i think so indeed				860.6767857377935
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening				697.8003997706968
don t ask me for counsel don t tell me you are perplexed what to do				929.5513170309406
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself				768.0245634603942

i shall be with mine under the third				25617.17086914865
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone				910.3589376692377
alas no said mme				49.693233089511494

you shall soon have something to drink i give you my word if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of athos				191.53602892961078
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached				3857.569005899575
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat				2394.338643931502
he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone				902.0641097532427
everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire				62449.78498227498
i will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family it would have been so unquestionably had not god given me so large a compensation				15469.70493843201

edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead				655.9205301353311

that s well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend here s to porthos and aramis				198.1177897531885
as d artagnan had foreseen athos was not within				9225.831953800303
mute with horror the three friends had remained open mouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible				9491.442712425227

half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed				66492.22341150977

the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters				44663.719604389866

who could have thought it				38.15944200172819
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations				22189.442739301823

yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal what				570.1609306169905
and when did he set out yesterday evening planchet my friend interrupted d artagnan you are really a precious fellow you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone				7005.295314815222
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies d artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard				4248.083637235743
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged				5056.558685047807

why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited				63139.781906697855

what do you mean grimaud he exclaimed				1890.2801485051677
the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips				413.114204575908

yes madame are you ready i am and his eminence the cardinal has got off without any accident				2230.5912696624064

as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing boats with their white sails were alone visible				4193.241907902782
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude				120083.1883335808

as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices				61316.29129023225
this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up				1095.6212612805311
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefort s bedroom				6700.072196597829
as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him				31.214744103590913
it was ten o clock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered				156549.60989490765
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn				866.0104211397227
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate				73784.10030174033
he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy				112034.17722336423

die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan				2588.4591482458895
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land				2961.043740113049
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years				1473.0462497862577
i did go to monsieur d artagnan s what was the aim of that visit to beg him to assist me in finding my wife				851.3069578934038

i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt				101295.94487943835
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city				2112.455449123044
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume				16182.607806155436
tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from aramis so there is said d artagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying d artagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge				9173.262053627637

don t condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this the same password exactly adieu master a good journey gentlemen				1525.8668809942474
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous				4797.70072715522
the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and four and twenty hours afterward i will answer for its being carried into execution				5695.775342197683

she was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her mistress				1070.2646975722616
where am i exclaimed she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady				3521.234258513479
thus the day passed away				530.9314573759577
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten o clock struck				2972.4798557006548
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil				1272.9650181730226
the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son				592.9595083145738
the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness but two million francs make a nice little sum replied morcerf				937.0478393950856
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent				29381.9134395733
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard				2391.779158208284
it is twelve o clock maximilian thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening or tomorrow morning				696.2837706565242
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile				415.84933890288676
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers				8677.99110621223
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you that is not the custom excellency said peppino				2843.432909502297
edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand				3445.4891680366404
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be hush				6555.859754668079
yes sir she replied every confidence speak will the queen deign to follow my advice speak let your majesty dismiss m de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables comminges glanced at d artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up				1112.5490080463067
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf				1001.9976520870096
i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment				6495.406770654507
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction				6692.128139484156
i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself				751.591784265849
go go directly d artagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady				818.8032152131999
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you				71.22126333425403

the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword				1157.0891499990687
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours				105509.16665456421
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is monsieur d artagnan and his friends he will bring them to us he knows them then doubtless				92085.37550114597

on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen				92498.52408443704
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain				1539.743625154209

he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find paris tranquil				78621.15483176662

five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona				19742.06158342771

another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder				53041.50270786645
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention				989.1144568241456
ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them i do not understand you baron said morcerf				1032.2488871357173

at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m de tréville				896.5511746669764
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing d artagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other				774.4355322426488

whether noirtier understood the young man s indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him				29.032096802464032
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy not i				1219.6630583572255
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly london sir if you please and my master lord d artagnan				136.57669563956048
he he murmured she can it be he and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed				13224.446293654199
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it				44.730692313864665
the young people uttered a cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again immediately				1640.6358905498234
the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of titian s portraits				101643.6360342922
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess				96416.42468339372
why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi				157739.53024838702
you want to know how we came here				504.1023253673617
give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate				2260.005660119212
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring				102743.16033775127
oh said he that is life to me more more two drops more would kill you replied the abbé				434.47344502082376
yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me				72.10022020078536
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted				12507.02532766456
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled				298.4135061618898
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign				3458.618186314941
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold				4506.236226768886
de saint méran yes suddenly from an apoplectic stroke an apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor				1270.0941294752154
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here				660.7400663094712

there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as i told you i expect someone at nine				7506.387455333421
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance				4402.034089832664
with francs we can reach marseilles with francs are you sure albert oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made				2526.964394683853

on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it				57.82232543044207
you told me that what matters it to you kitty				4577.17293082228
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish				63303.89948495212
i have replied morrel				190.52211120353192
adieu valentine adieu said morrel bowing				7385.3898826178765
lord winter is killed then inquired d artagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse				3815.6351274451395
d artagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms				606.1823122568744
one doesn t hit the bull s eye every time it is something to hit inside the ring				1444.0212212964302
suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance				729.6048387751764
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow yes for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two then we shall not meet in paris i fear i shall not have that honor well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse				3771.3254936321127
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble				103027.50931249022
go leave me i would be alone				840.9914306880803
but his majesty s decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it				59.815379931727726
then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled				10250.029845324283
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour				1370.939215609952
speak said the monk				13476.121514388951
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back				1063.741563089776
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable				8874.367601642827
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair				1660.9799527609387
but why do you ask i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know				702.7768427770187
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel morrel				444.3239006720748
as for me i am sure of it said the duke				676.6426225179634
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i don t know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason				15212.334098996944
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him				29.5950564644024
as for the théatre français you know of course that it is nowhere				121753.52461958758
i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error				28262.724201401015
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea				1045.8529811577712
i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related				31790.002093248484
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle				3836.1990319684323
now victory has abandoned him				26.94870004814024
what do you propose zounds				8261.973135935485
he made a great start and looked at me				41.617147719918655
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue				6455.9627335657915
but remorse is not thus banished like virgil s wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair				309.8264985807782
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful				6375.322838455816
hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of st gervais and do not bow too low to this italian that might give him a poor idea of you good answered porthos				74.65757462106639
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly				5248.034886970349
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours				4848.822656900225
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence				507.60491893221763
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs élysées				2904.235856689957
tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man				130.63540791900402
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all				280.3300703202585
what is done is done				874.9436037799428
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now athos come athos was about to retire				3017.293385402826
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection				3625.0777930914933
what time is it then eh				4032.532109492506
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator				74749.8771138747
then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress				1054.1522138525045
but the first was repugnant to him				26.104036765855984
he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre				6253.205523021983
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal				295.88728845111496
the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly				4355.402576722595
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary yes so it is between perfectly upright people one word more said monte cristo				152.9000137060586
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice				5890.679261582944
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation				55365.2352567992
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness				3203.2779749082274
my poor eugénie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady				3510.8830153296317
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you yes fair lady replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is i myself but this castle then is mine this chamber is yours i am then your prisoner nearly so but this is a frightful abuse of power no high sounding words				626.11388530953
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance				3459.6573369217786
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé				495.843662839592
at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of august and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes				387.8773059516689
valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husband s arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow				105854.35833808489
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				65.13985410027577
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de conti s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues				6380.371220984383
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money				968.0135140490826
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener				119176.99054086911
let us return to the object that brings me here what that which brings you home to me				63.11301605132891
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration				3185.4050189475524
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts				3929.6744897197937
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden				61723.57681108697
ah fie d artagnan replied				5282.934584218515
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo				275.10325282195123
dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered				87074.16741138304
one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the island of elba the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo				63102.21905656762
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you the old man nodded				21142.744709364357
but i could find nothing absolutely nothing				998.0564913843072
he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by vampa				3509.2929619943434
he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses				8970.65644111491
they were approaching the scene of war and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow				6212.9803096130845
come hither monsieur d artagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air				689.3906464996894
what granted me scarcely more				1594.9832765995877
yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon				2453.215275297745
finally d artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne				1974.2927036001881
come gentlemen your swords said the duke				765.562740367147
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter				4054.24175547178
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions				56430.78654193183
see the state in which he has put me oh my lord cried the baron i shall never console myself and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to him				28.95016862859147
he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam				20673.763514605773
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to watch valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred yes said valentine besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m noirtier s room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant				2254.7227152604687
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of				8381.330721208402
my dear count cried morcerf you are at fault you one of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist				61165.78424554096

monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly				3125.9751579156823
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look				716.6706798222818

i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies very well replied m danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker				16964.808173007248
haydée said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour				1345.3116686220965

morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake				14342.274596547586

the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it				56.78251474457857

i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than that he has made himself understood how was such a thing possible by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil good morning madame said the count bowing				3271.207890956469
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage				597.8199167502758
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human				147424.93492900152
why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair he took care not to do so monsieur on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing				1054.818950376753
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it				58.780804396483774

certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain				1296.4958282448506
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous that which we do not understand				2469.602290875917
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances				22549.73307869058
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet				97336.05171432637
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell				2484.293961968347
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility				46339.570332532225

well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal				284.2020369198604
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention				986.0567917925783
be kind enough then to send me francs tomorrow				3326.5647189789784

caderousse shuddered				3168.6107059237115
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m morrel				475.53665663377177
you have restored my courage by a single word go i will rejoin you milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found rochefort s lackey and gave him his instructions				3459.7464215000387

no said morrel i am not mistaken				2861.1710622968694

now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence				965.2829440660037
yes you are right let us go porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid				2733.717862691732

others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed a woman s letter monseigneur ah yes i see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders monseigneur said athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a woman s letter but it is neither signed marion de lorme nor madame d aiguillon the cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes				377.6297372837845
i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire yes said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him i think he was your colleague precisely answered bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another				532.4036403572577

dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury				20971.669498199244
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy				7262.8371091867975
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond				3022.4687135791028
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police				3623.408377255934
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following				28702.103309841877
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjust shamefully unjust				9614.981445458232
they want food already				6335.103480231369
and with his lackey he took the road to the governor s country house				404.8189391268143

mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini				46839.148558693196
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign				9703.75582165789
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideas no feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all				414.71665168685945
oh said porthos				14.169889169426241

he might fail but something must be left to chance				27555.09562526053

he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband				1652.4560366457215
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and château renaud				2232.1510946153935
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and i are under such important obligations chapter v the gascon and the italian				3661.2354197986538

he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier				8435.136123714927
d artagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into d artagnan s breast crying one for you and one for me the best for last cried d artagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body				1279.6863757193628

it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir				94887.86700407809
d artagnan was worn out with fatigue				15021.632800135274
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d artagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind				674.1840026683916
what the deuce can you expect				12329.043527070762
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces				7402.065983490857
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor				104618.12451753947
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention				983.3165861192601
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles				58062.01204034691
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties				54050.83559380783

monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward				1112886.0362964496
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing what are you saying asked the queen				304.2527563603958
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this moment				364.8198142423681
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort				221.2544617661999
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse				248.13223060450193
as luigi spoke thus he left her				109.18005600036106
he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before				1226.7930601218197
you will know that to morrow evening said the coadjutor smiling				570.7680762370785
he pressed the count s hand and left				1435.9046152570902
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her				130.16421237092067
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly				3707.5737751835345
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man				129.68686254599936
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so				343.3076079928895
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her				92.53680777627869
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband				1650.4424700479403
good by				14246.468030771763
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards				120988.19956819183
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy				49983.7980608431
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them				76.08060027515982
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn				861.2802891549161
let us go in said monte cristo				80.46061352805566
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m franz de quesnel baron d épinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect				24629.590691373607
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind				685.2712327802652
the real reason madame i can assure you i know my father but i want to know in what way m d épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person i believe i know m franz d épinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron d épinay by charles x the same said villefort				183.83758491972833
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them				80.75538570487652
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak				1806.5067303024105
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad				13781.536139122887
but at least you will be there will all paris be there oh certainly well like all paris i shall be there too said the count				160.80057126197738
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder				74221.37870581543
promise me that and i will die with that hope i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself did you see all that remember my words if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you also and you did not warn me cried caderousse raising himself on his elbows				119803.05549433695
come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the door				192.44060477790933
go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service				1509.9795678133996
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter				705.609525238656
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain				4721.180114821294
it is closed after them and they are arrested so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the habitués of the establishment				139646.89398652586
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself to them or to us do you mean aramis to no one				1023.7022112494295
our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes				386.73172939279505
if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star				22710.841458968323
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours count you who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists				87105.89462188607
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up				1097.1112073058273
what asked athos				10.947558618088022
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say				773.4667796109585
they have been speaking of my marriage have they not yes replied the angry look				1136.4704910811136
i could never agree to it still you have thought of it incessantly alas cried the abbé				513.5117577245707
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features				4460.831564124001
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary				2088.5306525153896
so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes				383.25915116563067
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you				63.04434739204782
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach				2226.4214925131587
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard				3314.667116271852
d artagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket				607.1184008972637
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain				3419.1456745710766
i am saved murmured he				68.45928605524246
the young men sprang up and seized their muskets				2827.5299871714906
ah may you be a true prophet said d artagnan laughing				1441.477846450259
whither are you taking me asked he				18.134071602596983
the cardinal s guards and m de la trémouille s people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them				81.26388836008134
you are going sir yes said cromwell				2039.5711466932742
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy				820.0668586612155
but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes the story will be very long excellency what matter				942.6200922878536
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats chapter lxxvi				74059.25056849707
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo				80.90149840456996
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear				13237.089371847493
where are you going cried the two musketeers in a breath				2393.956201750417
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surprise i want nothing you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other i hope there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome				874.4531075072446
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages				26533.08409774915
the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected				4037.3074761596986
in ten minutes it would strike seven				7202.799411716688
he grew pale and red alternately and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost				626.3907063834422
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape				1037.681431039537
he wished once again to press the count s hand but his own was immovable				2796.4091397598536
then he saw through the whole thing				1922.2747222369971
d artagnan				9.004192016353237
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall				10083.46996774995
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him				30.26122792493467
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so				336.4292872935826
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint méran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep				846.1728134171037
we can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay go go exclaimed dantès				222.081559740856
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain				1462.2786216185052
your mother has no longer either throne or husband she has neither son money nor friends the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother and she fell back weeping into her daughter s arms				604.1971931162465
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office				3264.8125940228297
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village				8774.115394602435
what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m magendie or m flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea pigs they have killed not one				1175.2675002863198
my dear count we have only just begun what induces you to think so the knowledge that i have of the queen s heart she will not rest contented beaten is she then preparing for a stroke i hope so come let us see what you know i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army ah				271.2274385451371
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head				465.5564232008036
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending				61464.58946781986
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife s chamber and found d artagnan just recovering his senses				3211.959478575599
yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine king s cockatoo				78299.70408953652
are you sure of it certain replied grimaud				287.94302822577146
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower				81961.18687309006
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud				5874.05724702228
d artagnan turned to porthos				77.34770818432627
the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work				1053.254344911044
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				488.0157458939777
it is strange said aramis				19.522592782555503
the king wishes to get a sleep one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone				1329.61422036279
this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was				553.5686348529774
how can i understand				1848.8565663137313
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds				1957.9303481717227
the sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said who are you gentlemen two gentlemen and where do you come from from london and what are you going to do in paris we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of england				755.0063429807158
all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way				511.2018034842847
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space				33356.55215942405
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water				1305.2619792441515
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o clock				1286.3266773061796
bonacieux pushed a little servants door open by day but generally closed at night				521.6429135726371
what are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder				7868.352206016253
he came toward teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening				698.1581839095186
their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets				99382.09231603458
of russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers				12529.612773131113
has it ever happened to you said monte cristo				80.37107734770285
come said monte cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again maximilian yes for i begin to suffer again the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation				10111.376685216253
why did you not have him arrested while in paris arrest the duke				1493.3338236102006
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercédès is not accountable to any person is she				1544.9189176333705
you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you				36.62623370083403
ah sir answered raoul you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel indeed the good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the morning s skirmish				26257.047213500486
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead				646.4920848427304
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her contempt oh yes i know what sort of vengeance				1543.4565741150582
at nine o clock the next morning the drums beat to arms				574.4541339115931
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter				1882.1171197481717
alas monsieur said she that is too bad what the devil do you see so bad in it said d artagnan				37.64303111250051
we are saved said valentine				265.13188330322333
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done				963.2731432489878
speak on they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent which of the two denounced him				30.162258232066446
to prison with him				28.181499704267697
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother				1643.3441549966412
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box				896.605897477999
they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received livres well sir and what then ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything really your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want				2405.523758363179
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse				5080.902249623213
so much the better				1004.1749129461801
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much				1830.5522395924118
come calm yourself and reckon them up m				662.1012888803276
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses				8901.465921531379
there is none said athos				10.726314012608384
come said he to the abbé i am anxious to see your treasures the abbé smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès				534.2219075310376
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or face it is not your fault				17695.45453826582
they arrived at ablain without accident				2384.359263770298
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside				5596.689248211972
she fainted				3262.391136603689
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat				1272.8047810452163
stop cried d artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men				872.7485227173637
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them				76.7971072258392
no count i hope i assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort				238.90081589546674
is there a secret spring said valentine				260.05286897222396
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on it is likely well will you try and overtake him nothing i should like better if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before louvres thirty and if we do overtake him forty said andrea after a moment s hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise				4322.390615682698
do you understand me				30.73876228127332
besides i shall only take the time to go and return yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him				27.646496630733843
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board				7413.941948609198
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison				6097.693215584352
eight thousand crowns amounted to livres he would then have about francs left				1447.4329434845679
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side				1125.605415312128
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left				1451.503875548677
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin				242.8241948947567
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter				630.8229892836256
i told him very humbly for i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty s musketeers i told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions				5565.594747467164
d artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles				6498.1205295402415

the four lackeys guarded the door and the window				530.1853900743288
and now remember one thing monsieur officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness i promised him to wait replied morrel and i will wait at this moment barrois entered				807.2216343613159

thanks to what aramis had told him d artagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon				28461.365028786542

valentine opened her eyes				377.3309428560088
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness				11824.328540587729
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless				4105.2253107544675
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events				3490.105301862822
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired				6206.554836194419

baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address				15557.11202656982
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said d artagnan				87.92610066189741
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said andrea				1432.1362274653225

how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling				555.6840995081473
we have accomplished more difficult things than that				571.853951278698
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s				766.3235146951312

is he afraid of me or of his father				971.2527849877529
he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks				22480.57142671598
no indeed sir answered raoul				324.6353154482072
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men				847.1360804060589
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed				321.9477505379224
this doctor has a niece continued aramis				92.30434094854029
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt				44899.333534279256

the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor s apartment				429.4145427084426
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream				1459.891728967284
your mother he said				270.2496498560448
there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty that is well				579.3274748580159
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations				23676.96694272768
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter yes d avrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation				4691.80771243315
and you i am going a few steps farther and monsieur leaves me here alone you are afraid planchet no i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that a lackey who has the rheumatism makes but a poor servant particularly to a master as active as monsieur well if you are cold planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six o clock in the morning monsieur i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold here s half a pistole				59872.20033201279

to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief				1306.4980229876126
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel				2349.8413183442317
stay said monte cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the iron work of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled				5221.555837858622
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				414.9019870014955
i said the novice				441250.4287438927
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				20253.798617483917
well yes you have to know me yet				5805.788509786515
as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect				6415.1000549750215
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saint jean aux bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest				4243.799535923589
i know him well there				518.9471085274022

allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment you know that is never refused among neighbors without waiting for the permission of his host d artagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the bed				319.9077109165599
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper				1000.5748498648356
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration				194623.0045659913
henrietta maria and mazarin				432.8241708038301
tis he				105.00674655337346
morrel whispered what have you done to him i				935.5807410978385
she looked at him in amazement				2180.5369466866796
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal ah mercy mercy cried caderousse				456.1156827539435
five answered groslow one every two hours d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive				115873.51398060667
no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation				169605.78460003473
i won t have dantès killed i won t and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied danglars				373.87413408672654
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros				86169.44197351867
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest				4140.541312143406
if you make a single step to find her you are lost that s pretty positive continued d artagnan but after all it is but a menace yes but that menace terrifies me				64.82630386621285
do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us				253.67069975460524
on the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the swiss guard germain whither d artagnan had sent for her				153.49808147115488
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed				90393.8932520704
then my lord then what asked mazarin				260.62614518581626
firstly i wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time				320.28731259466383

i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to wait let him be sent for instantly your majesty s orders shall be executed but but what but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey my orders yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that whenever it shall please your majesty but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france very well cardinal very well but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals				8944.51604266239
d artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress				17453.38971338787
ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband guilty though he were				1972.8782620843874

and to sign the contract in three days yes then in my turn i also say very well danglars pressed his daughter s hand in his				709.836645166326
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal lower				12613.524748115948
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics				213573.46376048855
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance				1541.1436597632517
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment				456.9969442854439
i ve a great desire to drink the king s health said athos				45.70378991751467
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men				876.5111962968009
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results				12759.397797171616
if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it myself i really think i must have been frightened				10237.281156909236
we have met him twice at general cromwell s				761.8192217451434
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one it s true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist				4995.679968489252
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful chapter liv				11044.076142217264
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse				936.6797326723682
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders				1159.7090290252972
have you not let it go out of your hands no d avrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them				78.54860113892376
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality				5052.4324719979795
you were writing i your fingers are stained with ink ah true i was writing				7913.2401992730065
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me the executioner of lille the executioner of lille cried milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling				5590.064098469751
anne of austria believed that louis xiii				1292.0227228659141
sir he said i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty				2081.335825018216
it is magnificent said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words				650.2183784524815
she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left				1457.093185110452
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon				1761.8802283856398
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto				13687.477997611802
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure				944.7151787222957

there are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said d artagnan let us ride onward at about half past eight o clock they reached the first houses in noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village				9045.22277614869
i suspected where she was concealed				5670.832445794764
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor				24180.86826357069
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished				22302.818464683845
oh do not deny it				38.43886552602528
oh enough of this enough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb				3445.2460219013847

i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me				78.1101092088109
it can not be surely valentine you are mistaken no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited				124273.23901740316
coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her				145.2527159258008
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come i have been advised of it but the three millions the three millions are probably on the road then i shall really have them oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment				354.33915398919794
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out				389.6465326716109
from avignon to marseilles seven francs				612.5894946571016
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly				43291.17152742252
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever				7174.656777192197
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words				638.8100343413879
come in gentlemen d artagnan obeyed for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself				195.58876709322655
the carnival was over				2173.457294245318
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto				14938.929564986402

at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				196.34650882883759
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate				16006.800892215952

the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				17971.340698574342
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand				157.46153612782518
bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition				6761.772227178651
m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character				3917.7003552675405
a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating				119116.65446470777
i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him oh no our breakfast comes from my father s kitchen				3573.344417716612

these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood				2533.723551152938
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth				1371.475366525265

his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column				18013.173720993902
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth				1214.0880119650878
ah it is no then yes valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns				48380.857696229396

the unknown chapter				311.53875439619685
the woman s hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face				318.8474612483133

athos made him a sign to go to d artagnan s residence and bring back some clothes				8156.137524799862
very well cried d artagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner pooh				5605.909219195947
does he regret me a little				1317.559617071644

mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise				3298.921197969582
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window don t open the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture				2667.4871709328268

the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on				928.4965504958105
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal				403.0304000255374
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating				96744.04573060918
this measure somewhat reassured bonacieux				3690.4892931104437
now said gondy there is a communion between us				256.39752902948703
help comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder				7523.817494764319
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend				277.2331520213066
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal				6983.5764647192755
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired				6182.434419925458
but how did this horse come into your hands mousqueton pray said the lackey say nothing about it monsieur it is a frightful trick of the husband of our duchess how is that mousqueton why we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of quality the duchesse de but your pardon my master has commanded me to be discreet				296329.39976297

this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age				2878.9347569850283
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz				586.4281418989128
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the count s iron grasp				2495.2816962672305
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni it was your excellency the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me				74.37310830711257
read for yourself and judge porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur d artagnan who must follow the bearer well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied d artagnan				150.44728351682596
my lord said athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants my most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved it				53.60893109851762
héloïse héloïse he said what is the matter				941.2564695645374
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared				404.97030506501346
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held				5076.160693503774
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future				1833.1596276304067
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek				130990.59203544719
at this moment a patrol passed by				14091.654910608662
at st omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed again				257.4886907084716

will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example				2532.090626946305
the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass				7435.481596065079

how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment d artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris and did not stop till he came to athos s door				179.07824240707336
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed				38139.63553459349

the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle				4248.2943094488855

i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch				1436.4483641695251
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed				74639.74855883801

caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room				92.47677314960346

these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him				28.710217637353804
his heart beat but not like d artagnan s with a young and impatient love				920.977529874918
that is useless yes yes				1103.679499989487
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal				88221.47270892122

jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was				554.273069588166

i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke and even then when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces				7376.267460646804
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead				668.8883409065636

if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him				31.788619636273893
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on				876.6913525982789
he launched into a eulogy of his eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m de cavois instead of m de tréville				888.4152000629858

when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence				15658.83523426105
yes these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation				89571.37059138242
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his				690.7410633339392
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo				328.86415413503244
in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones				14812.584221900564

but she had her son				704.018180321747
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis				221.77763246215235
one day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from england the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by cahusac and la houdinière strolled along the beach				66703.91161735808
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dantès eagerly				3583.483368602539
the coachman stooped down for his orders				3486.9613582919283
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed				11626.153586752214
with the first light dantès resumed his search				2851.256085253493
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal				380.2080682199054

he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos				10.559239985589404
you see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another				567.8016099588134
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme				198.32242274684737
order was re established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another				553.1883961247187

he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile				426.26179976065015
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine				1864.953789942555

it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery				15240.722937412145
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it his threat completed the intimidation of the host				936.0707087408558
i have just made m de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned				2012.9892767635126
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation				738.0830545709872
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her				127.40094405682845
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions				26435.439254021407
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold				2795.5292132493946

it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression				2731.2188192687036
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged				19124.865409856608
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort				281.5731589371837
here it would be dangerous the house may be watched				16991.864670730738
let us know when breakfast is ready				1703.662365337893
he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage				100504.49053043427
haste said felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead then continued milady then i collected all my strength i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck				2975.381248364056
to reach england athos lowered his voice all france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed				7888.50327917272
which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour d artagnan and athos laughed aloud				7378.589229725838
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron				198635.42323069402
there was a great press of people in m de villefort s antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name				507.6710014874838
the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it				61.27633024546479
blaisois went with him				28.238271832707614
ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by another where is he then in the cellar the cellar what cellar our landlord s to be sure				3553.853994037169
the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the faubourg saint honoré his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count s and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing room				93.05646531737221
this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left				1452.5161238423534
it was caracalla s circus				267720.2390702161
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count				234.50493112240147
the trial chapter				305.79988217777895
nonsense cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method what i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted and then asked mazarin turning pale				744.9801278115268
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations				120319.56142922053
two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five				5590.693203732635
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels				11565.60737798441
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours				4918.55746757251
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded				4358.157307906144
the cardinal s hair stood on end				993.2679829844675
we will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor				2819.4626756422526
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie precisely said the cardinal				299.7986767018841
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed				694.5759964463331
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo				118643.88941891049
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them				76.01076081171976
te deum for the victory of lens				52424.90036591611
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned				324395.9620837694
in the first place do you accept asked the cardinal				255.48928354666717
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them				77.59103357345417
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch				4069.573989158179
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth				1217.8916880514005
what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers he had scarcely finished when d artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time				325.26828229022266
but then he may have stopped at saint germain i don t think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette i was there this very day and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling				561.5181684845674
the commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the table				679.0341138757142
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers that s true said dantès but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three others do you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it				60.58288874861544
m de tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker				28681.936895633284
an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons he had an only daughter who married m de villefort who had been the king s attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles monte cristo glanced at bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling				5506.007285255203
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong				11586.36204472062
a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake				99347.8832932807
no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers				205442.9189547202
oliver cromwell very well monsieur mordaunt said mazarin give me this second letter and sit down the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat				3471.8932519275522

monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command courage haydée dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pasha it was a friend				313.94131267521

villefort was about to retire but m de blacas taking his hand restrained him				30.181896715255817
do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three thousand the deuce does his island produce him such a revenue it does not bring him a bajocco then why did he purchase it for a whim he is an original then in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad				2057.0492736027886
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid				2469.213714063586
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud				818.0749860428709
he sent one of his servants to m de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal s guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king s musketeers				2625.5619094480517

he has followed us several times as i think when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness				2279.854345939186
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken				3499.040223578503
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you				63.13827049831281
milady oh yes said porthos true i had forgotten it athos looked at him intently				11435.203520111429
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love				926.0284527002865
i resisted				23878.87633422531
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last comminges appeared pushing broussel before him				29.924900873767704
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it now they begin to look concerned nonsense				12869.248916439958
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine				1868.8226049843415
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake				4921.912463170284
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn				17241.614300566165
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties d artagnan would become the preserver of his friends				321.70206417296066

julie mindful of emmanuel s request was following her father when he quitted the room but he said to her quickly remain with your mother dearest julie wished to accompany him				28.925427709022408
at this moment the duke s surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admiral s ship where they had been obliged to seek him				29.532641392670225
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				6919.865706482302

oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition				246508.46091370162
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantès sank again into his seat				3367.6908287623837
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say m de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it				54.45300611422173
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body was that i saw that i heard				550.0378357737097

a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences				46067.0859792903

only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning				6046.779605365256

he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine				1124.5281762977975

ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame				1026.642583594018

ah is that you d artagnan and you athos said the young man				69.51534951619419
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface				96788.52638728943
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat				200239.9298803853

yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper d artagnan who was accustomed to his friend s manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athos s arm and went out without saying anything				1057.2138229383916
the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe				56816.239838943555

the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal				20812.038988025208
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done				929.1573560816024
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers				197049.2229926624
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne it was the point where he had embarked				71098.50538328772
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep				854.856524416747
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous				107015.24966633896
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls fêtes or carousals as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna estafania the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu				1257.6103010387026
i missed her by twenty minutes at st omer				66629.46142795388
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy				15260.561149247858
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant yes well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you certainly				5623.761855448048
from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years				1468.1390243086892
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed				186083.04398821873
you ve killed him i think no wounded his horse only what would you have my dear fellow				2289.8275863126087
no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscount s door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell a falsehood				8421.696650359407
well said milady i have not seen our gascon this evening what milady				629.1506571944352
oh very shortly madame said he but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day				295.87684797133795
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal				4478.013169819514
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage				6260.001664448613
they can take place at rueil				31888.686199729556
they have closed up the grating with a board that is well god has made them senseless said felton				1172.8076312940534
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns				234331.13691585467
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				1168.022510882468
but be of good cheer with certain people everything comes round oh you render me the happiest of men				844.8399374508836
i told you so said d artagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it and you monsieur d artagnan what do you want my lord said d artagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant yes and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain d artagnan bowed				670.1142340347635
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefort s departure				2233.860066488606
oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought				1386.2371889668361
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop				1045.374835691584
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				1017.6894663803452
if we can not we will do without him				25.511316864646513
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon				2441.459128122253
silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report				14348.814103536659
what are you doing reverend sir				587.7957301856778
d artagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance				12288.475143134974
but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate				2066.565129621049
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day all day yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box you know him then yes and no how so it is a long story tell it to me it would frighten you too much so much the more reason at least wait until the story has a conclusion very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance				2524.775947773938
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man				120.9883033456233
in the proper time and place i will remember everything				377.6889842670458

i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong				3429.2493383955284
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating				109748.8005398106
he is my demon apparently				282496.15300429286
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do				917.7763867211627
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him				24.42824935179308
remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for his sake yes yes everything for him				30.19513292270829
oh my god my god have pity on me without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting				6730.536988046383

how few to day exist plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me no i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers monsieur d artagnan				151.7291632433937
four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received				2177.9006678476703
judge for yourself replied he				16.483416462643333
italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head				458.0096173594411
you have decidedly some genius at your control ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf				1023.2541974780847
she is what the english call a yacht where was she built i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor				6103.662544469926
in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters				17099.837927577093
a month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow				5874.52782862334
whom shall i announce said the attendant				1146575.8477178556
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery				110693.35826190481
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger				2833.859104563071
still replied porthos				11.063057688521345
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other				775.5463827768078
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold				3157.1154419595523
now that never happened to us when we were four together				846.0437075426472
she had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of san felice s daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her				135.82236143766906
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared				1117.5522738691943
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return				2541.8179258471473
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you				71.62152686287908
oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade				175590.62462459598

do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself yes sir then you have seen him certainly i have where				4957.739347761123
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles				8231.246257950092
are you there now certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle the fingers resumed the jesuit st				3613.011744667699
two men to the astonishment of d artagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier				5789.0471681789095
a bad relapse that will lead you if i mistake not to the place de grève				101693.47279950892
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery				14932.84738849997
they proposed a game of bouillotte				115999.89074078135
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughter s grave				12141.511549562543
we will escape and if we can not escape we will talk you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love				927.7627749275052
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message				17816.884932358767
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain				1341.612773185194
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords				5239.423494341725
i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat				65788.61260523599
i adore rome and i have always had a great taste for archæology come two or three more such adventures and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready				1711.6209966524495
scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun				106598.74836787082
in the name of heaven run call				7126.927087669652
my lord he said which way do we go				1192.0051203950638
but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray				601.4190776927153
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain				13897.89414270639
god grant you as much				2079.460923884876
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared				1113.855877600568
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn				9386.537717784906

in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual				271837.1700802921
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand				161.00795926666186
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères luchon and cauterets				171865.7810748151
the count praised bertuccio s zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month				3761.9284722653774

they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily				114290.38510637957
and how does m de villefort bear it as usual				2301.1147275770463

speak my child speak said d artagnan i listen here				498.65170377480564

you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii				1367.9804314842647
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church				4577.138009897367
but i can t be severe with him he is really so bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m de villefort				229.7447254990953
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible				2300.3665199642537
the company of m le chevalier dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d artagnan				119.19454025810315

six days				1770.1977632705427
gentlemen said d artagnan you shall have your turn				841.6818624200008
it was therefore near seven o clock but edmond s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head				460.14876308174814

but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse				881.4821630348225
i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage then i have your leave sir yes if you have nothing more to say to me nothing captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me he was unable to write sir				830.310998254075

you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them				69.17948433481064
on seeing him d artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise				1637.7649581521775
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed				55105.48768914871
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini				4133.8615097569755
i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her capital but how will you get me out of paris oh				898.1257886029596

villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				409.39672640845197
well that was a temptation for two wretches like you				71.58792936914782
adieu madame				689.1858799473222
it is you who stabbed selim				12137.378533130832
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened athos you are becoming mad no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta				8051.1585670782815
beauchamp pulled out his watch				1414.2383133562964

our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed				4899.540693938997
then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss				7637.8631150656065
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows				120521.91327523584
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected				4165.11580747708
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athos s closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords				5576.773496036033
my lord excuse me				33.23901500160497

they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned				117455.71887617065
olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of trees				4348.301501372134
something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel				75739.70683789697
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room				93.262004832789
the third act passed off as usual				2348.6964548557535
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm				105428.29807025085
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial				2237.287270590511
he lost it the day before yesterday and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst raoul wrote on thus sir after a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me				73.6428632772864
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard				45243.19833615974
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning				1834.2394820638428
porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room				93.34119644081895
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage				12575.917514531602
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state				19317.85167195705
the four muskets made but one report but four men fell				4295.843367109644
the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious				42959.1519969269
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem				78768.10081995586
he is really dead				623.6568397255501
now really let me ask sir have you do you believe you have anything to do				926.3826553738576
but hark				285042.43230097595

he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders				1169.5551460074644
now as at the moment in which d artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance				790.5074908940743
bayonne yes the road to bayonne and afterwards the road to châtillon yes by the tower of montlhéry you mean yes thank you				51.83992723234302

mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life that of standing behind a gilded carriage				575.8099972993813
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent				79823.1663160868
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet				550.3752293334954
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course				1834.5937428545424

mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed				1774.4825075857348
athos repeated m de tréville himself				169.24892232795565
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau				194872.2485685047
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which d artagnan took and shook in his				724.6367328835064
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza				86945.63279800999
the young man knelt down				792.3547836311033
that was not the appointed hour				1255.7317233821366
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death				420.53782332753195
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished				12575.845554760248
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find mme				134.3004226167781
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children				5220.465405384506
another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground covered with blood and almost fainting				138429.39512546896
as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux				62068.77630286226
see here it is the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose it s false caderousse started and turned pale				876.0808102946174

while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant				30586.523461874815
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child				1072.323353117294
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed				1520.8090727910485
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head				446.2797285857359

porthos knocked with his hand				149.55029122130168

i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again				268.1451439147763
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman				1013.4212532201353
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl				85122.98882138294
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe				11865.435224232227
a shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third				23648.23989723557
two soldiers were accordingly sent for and the inspector descended a stairway so foul so humid so dark as to be loathsome to sight smell and respiration				186239.27664227746
this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume				1476.0035221210683
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinal s party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments				10205.152724351336
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner				1035.4058472964239
d artagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it				57.95316372565856
still further athos obtained of m de tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nights for they set out on the twenty fourth at five o clock in the evening and as a further kindness m de tréville post dated the leave to the morning of the twenty fifth				58293.04050279908
come milady opened the window and made a sign to mme				174.2814830800986

ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded oh things take their course without our assistance				4795.143735612553
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key				3406.5205862457838
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses				99418.11453940146
the tocsin was sounded				2119.34044116828
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on but morrel albert is your friend simply an acquaintance sir you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me thank you morrel then ringing the bell once look said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor				107673.29143943713

well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my turn may require your aid and influence let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith of hush interrupted the stranger i hear a noise tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however i may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby well then if you obtain the reprieve the middle window at the café rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross and if you fail then all three windows will have yellow draperies and then and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess we understand each other perfectly then				877.4253181328405
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning				1743.2088434853522
see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them				80.10394469137654
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society				3414.437133847523
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert				199.11866760989315
sit down and let us talk it over milady murmured athos				71.43066811537143
leave the room and send me a woman women are very indiscreet my sister				3522.0134263831565
that evening i had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them a second time with me				71.63515472957233
have we ceased to be men no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew de winter only replied by a groan				3423.6550039705803
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight o clock in the morning				699.930500258499
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion				1011.354143817009
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man				66.16225020139906
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice my advice is this said monsieur d arminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat				2114.7573693279237
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy				125522.83310145825
his mother the councillor s old servant opened it				45.351969379027274
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent				2700.3762979588096
ah yes he said i know them				97.48472524717158
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me how dear sister said lord de winter				722.2826428823557
at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said edward dearest do you see that good man				122.28956499104734
mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key bravo said aramis how did you manage it like everything else with money but it cost me dear how much asked athos				64.49316307590986
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before				1238.715192763672
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey and do you command nothing in your own name in my name said mme				124.49985866565265
then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure				5349.308177549567
grimaud followed athos				110.17534005576731
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship				4825.6876734445
do you not remember him yes said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air				690.4776167810206
milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years				1435.3583344423914
with the entrance of m morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste				1675.530893625665
the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond dantès				599.505584363509
where were you born continued the president				1211.7826193599053
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer tis true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions				38898.549247294875
before his departure the count went to haydée s apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care				1157.6818738515315
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape				1024.2871691377904
we are all mortal my poor friends you are late my dear porthos yes there were some people on the way who delayed me				65.39511610821016
ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have it good god cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear d artagnan i think yes cried d artagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my friend ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires				346027.12985015276
let us dispense with useless words				559.9222247503391
a gentleman laughed in my face				414.6771031107825
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are lost				634.547314294453
but what asked the groom				24029.054148416744
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart				319.1583790631312
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us meantime here we are enemies said porthos				51.90231893890896
very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he doesn t wish to speak				1601.2594600487434
a hundred louis				3149.1317205738505
the devil said porthos				12.789030343487022
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size				122635.91597835485
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret				2178.5186653714254
d artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own				705.4547702248776
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying				3000.0804570026403
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlightens				193927.11190916033
besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too an excuse for us				253.86806162396044
and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente				69744.61692616495
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				891.3358313173197
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open				3348.9580057859866
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder				1367.9354232554954
there will be eleven crowns gained it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse				2716.878690939837
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus				132407.3228340833
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin				481.27062822867435
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand				159.62789636310723
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden				2546.9390701487496
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy				923.0359566264705
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said d artagnan				171.5783537154679
i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month				3743.3509795198197
yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling				189892.95785670672
d artagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly				4216.053972509031
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real				16527.689362233246
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre				11412.477343580866
they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles				83272.69189739978
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille go to				2676.579316294093
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday				4129.739859864241
maximilian said the count you should not look on the graves but there and he pointed upwards				64084.13805632847
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it				56.4035296098761
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity				1657.3817626519608
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results				15160.470948797958
the man somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said				394.7544219529691
you look careworn really you alarm me				29.3522026145491
but to return to the charming musicians you should give us a treat danglars without telling them there is a stranger				2824.5303273759832
what exclaimed porthos mutton again my dear monsieur de comminges said d artagnan you will find that my friend monsieur du vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat mutton every day i declare said porthos i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away remove the mutton cried comminges i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite is mazarin dead asked porthos				173.80470459727644
when i awoke a fresh meal was served				11487.987435383624
but you my dear d artagnan what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said d artagnan				51.45222982362554
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello				71473.22957758557
monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it				60.92624067754959
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps follow me monsieur said mazarin				347.08569352592
if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husband s chest m coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a siesta				410706.21415827295
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athos s aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athos s residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin				39646.42887971334
mazarin breathed again				235.6037874482472
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words				589.8321410983584
he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to la ramee s heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination				21852.4493078488
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men				877.5751141784399
speak speak take this letter said d artagnan				4.206079369671176
scarcely had he shut her door when mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed				24425.409675699408
certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart				296.6809950173674
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said you are monsieur d artagnan i am that individual replied the officer				2332.2596780803397
you have a sad air alas said d artagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate tell me presently said d artagnan				51.91926236307905

in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him				28.458872049198487
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm				1353.412377032714
pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring				21830.140934358373
where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance				2944.2878819231582
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess				1372.7531656394883

you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy				933.8968182565038
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart				306.9241494830766

valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it				52.482735415231595
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails				7002.750403735791
when i like caderousse was thoughtful for a moment				384.83661613652623
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission				12215.844069105286

you foolish fellow said athos laughing				1109.6900842471553
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo what do i think said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars such was albert s opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it				60.00254958744395
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him				29.933977527813674

for i had forgotten him said the lieutenant				1467.8828235198152
nothing she replied with a violent effort				140156.15944540265
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right				1154.4663815840793
cowardly court				1468.7061850557434
alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments i need a friend do you suffer much asked the monk				11924.764489139858
he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke				88404.14942372567
since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver				294486.3744326284
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort				1892.5890283312747
the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity				2018.1301645489268
a conjugal scene chapter				287.9899893167089
but continued aramis the details escape me and me also said porthos				26.185594633672956
she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently				28916.51486450862

he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape				1141.241711799492
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation				108327.11452392841
what were you doing in the battle my friend inquired athos of the youth twas not your right place i think as you were not equipped for an engagement i had no intention of fighting to day sir i was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for rueil when seeing monsieur de chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side				1122.9244240444848
the three musketeers chapter i				1176.0932759766472
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to d artagnan				54.75724344655346
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace				2003.3943386599476
what then have i to fear from him you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life				430.12339477346353
when my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said this man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived yes but your father was not allowed to fall				3434.410618890435
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				2542.8326001372693
but felton did not give him time to draw it				50.52989906555072
d artagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party				2335.5048408401717
as for me i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance				1531.2247801335338
i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it without any fault of mine i can honestly declare				109908.32056345628

if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself you do not understand me maximilian				1332.3496110438464
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m d épinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile				417.6824164567974
but how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the president				1165.1443696422145
i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth				1372.3578564187303
but what are you looking for i am looking for the person who let down the ladder				3369.730863363477
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes				40661.15635121704
at what said milady with the utmost ingenuousness				112954.98372021681
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg™ works				1851.8131812098904
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together				841.6577820532316
it was a strange thing and one which made d artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder				11424.553847921326
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof ah no madame that could not be				493.26777900889294
yes my captain as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking				113642.50441139354
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed imperceptibly				12340.3245035056
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice livres per annum from the day i was married				14319.355159684621
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire				3262.1422454072913
and is it your cook who prepares these pills asked beauchamp				541.0833748864329
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends				326.75177434604575
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count				243.13226938468716

his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer				761.1892198436502

but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion on the honor of mazarin i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself then aloud may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin go pray sir one word more my lord if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter tis well said d artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money				867.6182716153273
the total amount was found to be as m noirtier had stated				71077.62456601288
that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret well what is to be done if monsieur chevalier would follow me said kitty timidly				1721.031028475906
on the evening of the of september m morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study				880.2053054283324
ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abbé smiled				294.8594027752678
yes continued the cardinal				354.1540199357416
adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer				1215.3657864385405
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another				580.0942851543921
but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down				728.4152865248533
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory oh murmured valentine				800.4850507413081
good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door				191.6226307599026
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d artagnan				40.00955838989352
this was not enough he must now learn to write				6256.581787329836
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach				23308.666973908676
at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle s robe and spend all your time reading your breviary				9440.63595975296
do you pity him				25.77299971300026
the miserable villain				17560.560698522862
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left yes the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices yes but you say she is english she is called milady but she may be french				1779.256065028452
no by your eminence by me				55.2896450174321
he had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine				25571.99001807173
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again athos put his arm around aramis s neck and embraced him				29.82461339212131
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone				7860.687012073067
did you hear eternal sleeper cried d artagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night				526.3224055721779
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow				1732.0464484164124
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other				778.1471652217025
your eminence is right				1151.0484888985466
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the diamond the devil said d artagnan becoming angry again				213.15102291335546
oh i confess it is all the same to me oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady macbeth				115228.96608846853
this lady is infamous my lord milady de winter is an angel you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you bah				10919.167322754138
read the address monsieur el comte de wardes the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon				2459.387790340047
if he comes shall we not know it how nothing easier				26317.163457932806
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere				6111.199446616532
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic				54657.57211052171
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted alas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where				4837.335904842978
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon				2505.850785279546
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him				31.069632583840416
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions				3284.5936174313238
the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass				7733.675987407615
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything				415.03832162757453
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me mercédès burst into tears her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories				35834.13425609509
that is to say when you have received my instructions				4238.274656607071
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your boarders said milady oh my god				414.1455411144945
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience anne colored slightly				30172.25861030321
a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead				60006.131880852336
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed				2506.4913242953417
where are we going inquired aramis are we going to fight perchance				210262.11358943162
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview				3099.1442434983405
until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal let it be then the day after to morrow said aramis				81.14335021100132
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away				518.8934139470437
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied d artagnan				25.07184468982504
is he dead				654.0466083905499
these arrangements made the lackeys retired				1181.8899746229404
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres that is admirable said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other				773.232984530059
pardon me at least such i have heard is your custom nay madame				952.9549609098141
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan				29317.927718109724
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed				1491.184898548182
who knows said gondy such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart				319.3552169779623
upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a tremble				1264.0474431294042
the vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again				269.1372626331871
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants				15059.529141366002
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives but what is that to me provided i see you again				242.9696676771664
yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you				78.85843820329124
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank				3008.621530115018
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour to tell you that you are free your excellency my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleon s maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life				457.6939255853972
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage				595.7238278201222
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me				70.75572660997061
so said charles he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere sire said aramis				85.05883236482327
well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice				2746.8171179092533

speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris				366.346713175756
excuse curiosity but i wish to be enlightened on the subject because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and i choose to dispose of them as i like allow me allow me sir said d artagnan to observe you are in error				25971.59402503913
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it				54.25739880000199
the minute hand moved on				859.2956588694599
to the rescue as usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their comrades				4080.79790576177
porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches				137066.34633904154

i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the day				295.05490144509423
the heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after				7188.491516200131
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy				13155.814940007578
that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelor s revenue could not suffice for the coming month s outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs				653.1879603957767
in his eyes and to his conviction mme				137.75004686751961
the count advanced to meet him				25.222518539523858
i my lord said d artagnan why should i because you shrug your shoulders it is a way i have of speaking to myself				734.2890133930539

himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein				84825.25684211492
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow				9656.360763984474

i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough				1337.6210454171403
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i am i am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it				52.02087788959331
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit				10456.720015924562

there was a crowd on the pier				234585.3664672212
he let off his fire at but four paces				11687.718950633693
there was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this house				405.4485217998244
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face				333.9484096297674
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to écarté it is not only a game it is a hors d œuvre				121727.63412705492
and now once more adieu said morrel				188.95131898989814
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in				554.4678914417725
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors				80990.55191394054

this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle				2577.5834252335876

oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly jealousy indicates affection true but i am not jealous he is of whom of debray no of you of me				69.07403825055162

as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine s room to m de villefort so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward				4219.042442765037
who told you so				215.76222238981836

no replied athos with a singular smile				363.2383058208086
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered				133821.89088206683
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd				7625.366662889948

the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone				912.8496915454984
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy				241304.7639483681
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door				191.6062757283599
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage				919.1279066936249
she was my mother				976.1054963375733
no doubt you come to join the princes as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud				812.8846194598234
would you like me to send edward to you for a short time it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven				533.6292091609677
beware my dear d artagnan				6.042756678238894
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry out				342.0083159773521
and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him				29.756797246330617
d artagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong				11283.326571330143
franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hôtel de londres was the palace the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase				9214.392282925543
how pale you look it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort m				618.754819306417
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time				324.12642870549377
this cavalier is my attendant would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host				889.5147745731305
so au revoir dear athos au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought				211982.97540317278
besides what was morcerf seeking				4684.752330202944
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i don t know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself				754.4506842719517
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him				26.09252548310263
while d artagnan was examining mme				146.95825168674736
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable				79984.18125976404
rinse the glasses said grimaud				294.26133567222473
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully				13030.599712529887
in a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada on the of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth time the papers i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hands and i fell asleep about three o clock in the afternoon				36940.5817408301
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope				100463.2841029167
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness				149141.82373422958
mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred				4448.083020185166
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place oh				780.2698608976085
i will pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn				9623.18252842734
and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i don t know but what i should have held on by my original plan				3098.0597375408206
his companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out				331.43145649461803
rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by jove				34888.957410598654
the slave of the count of monte cristo				319.1591399969107
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal				53110.3420140226
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern				86811.24406601707
it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey				1968.215819945748
in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door open				3720.6190891108404
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract				38203.77826886797
if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle				1962.234364105347
how much do i owe this gracious prince				619.0218929155728
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the count s hand and covered it with kisses				8349.411423938966
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet				14787.375979417968
here is my pass countersigned said the latter				4202.541852636857
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground				993.0828120577507
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused				10769.21323886169
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her				138.6913522194264
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray				4215.844899088873
the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screw driver to take them off				1705.9385191546842
never cried d artagnan				5.0321141130214295
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric				63192.069981752735
the mêlée became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers				2589.9135308694676
the scotch he exclaimed the scotch i called my faithful to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford				104381.43507308191
i am going away the day after tomorrow do what you please monsieur chevalier				80948.77660400364
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone				5502.485033127761
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells yes sir a rope ladder and tools and have you them yet no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left what is it asked the count impatiently				3602.3254325233684
no i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse did you see her after her return from brussels after the king s death yes she is still beautiful yes said aramis i saw her also at that time				310.58916660827475
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay				6786.24989974752
d artagnan remember this				2231.8977883140387
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand				30584.18998434275
an approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him				30.23496288631431
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master				1070.3708539677818
at daybreak d artagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done				940.9073476522963
what are you about asked d artagnan				4.4246595870637915
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one				1151.4755832883707
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage				908.8157443370403
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian				11338.447533903878
i can not cry at my age they say that we have no more tears still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping				25537.359064315744
be satisfied of that these two can not have drunk all the cellar				3968.5788213327965
the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination				22564.619520334043
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him				31.156548516710252
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon ah my dear m cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends i am at your service sir replied the major				5102.340347408341
yes shall i call him yes valentine went to the door and called barrois				10983.690764940844
i have not tried to discover her other name kitty cried milady				261.3063250839495
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again				249.24668468873483
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget				82727.00052297411
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian s taste				11521.528179886116
really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease indeed you give me more credit than i deserve i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all when shall you send your invitations this very day well i will immediately call on m danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow				2822.51751758187
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance				1546.730725731553
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of it shall be done replied bertuccio				2505.647663441974
to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb				3196.421000261488
laporte entered				762.5268246130048
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison oh pardon me sir let me live she is cowardly said villefort				203.62253621388237
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road				1201.2097828246115
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me				61.945740589730065
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape				1056.1572140956841
i told you this i am now grieved i have kept my word				516.3275210595853
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twenty four hours				4899.475278449985
how did this happen said morrel				191.30208928792953
de saint méran madame de saint méran m noirtier how				1347.47203067598
it was alas				1686.1569974131305
d artagnan looked at porthos				53.52617179820429
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week for as i had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearly my wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears truly yes				964.2616569551374
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us no on the faith of a cardinal				357.0198579434536
you may now retire				3943.678040234655
ha said rochefort you are right				1147.031254212272
it is well said monte cristo				78.78263015257207
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service d artagnan i shall be grateful to you all my life very well				528.3173735161064
caderousse had once more parted with his treasure the banknotes were replaced in the pocket book the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard				25059.094153467
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon				2452.006016571376
have the fugitives been pursued yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted how many are there four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded four said d artagnan looking at porthos				96.72563187176098

thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and tréville next or even perhaps before himself				196.21220246269823

some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale				88807.98057344442

monte cristo drew out his watch				1438.9300314992663
what say you i can not believe such was the case				2293.0924337589113
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop				3866.1134203812844
see and she exposed her face completely to view see misfortune has silvered my hair my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my brow is wrinkled				82257.73016745427
thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying he s too ugly the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed				15144.430891662532
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured				29042.428738005074
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone				1336.4492322019662
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying				93567.35984264966
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you i shall take better care of them myself answered d artagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape				1041.7656516968293
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks				147671.7455831306
grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor				1764.0028341045593
what are you doing cried kitty				3544.741917421916
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantès the worthy dantès look here and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor				14728.531486688364
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade				3581.4300539886754
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses peste said porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin				500.4861802932007

danglars left				1354.404008965679
oh said dantès timidly what is the matter villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter				631.5627887562442
who and what are you demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hour s time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim				4450.060242004059
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo				296.52329953967904

if i had but the time to train pupils				205627.9560334726
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder				3092.0914139525344
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs				1277.9533561276771
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles				1203.1094811733237
and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you he did and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter yes and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier yes why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed				4639.924550404523
it is well said the abbé we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour				1364.489197474213
answer me on what i could get you lie repeated the abbé a third time with a still more imperative tone				900.2670663151447
let go and clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards				94534.07058553514
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time				333.21417071252966
great god she is losing her senses while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt				3251.65322587331
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep				3075.947477716727
d artagnan was a woman and still more a mother				1102.4991696027982
i am no swordsman well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter				941.6353549954645
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously				316273.287834893
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room				92.84699566881899
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him				31.515222591035336
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ring true said my mother				964.4695070496358
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing decidedly my dear athos said d artagnan i should like better not to risk anything that s a pity said athos coolly				11825.422417350732
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable				34070.94140975241
and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation				742.6265193288117
for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks				2818.793231694304
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs				88230.39142229153
it was his cornelius nepos that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his years the fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him				29.75983387864189
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied				1627.2296503468058
i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water				1296.2510372722138
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night				521.4031845446791
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand				158.8372596195364
oh my god my god i thank thee madame said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice				179.33938801901704
farewell he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head				477.03012826694004
monsieur is i am sure an honest man take away that fool said the cardinal				264.87422854645564

at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room				91.47498962938006
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again				267.2333823647995
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass				1079.0112712564323
the foundation s business office is located at north west salt lake city ut				7840.636904787535
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him				31.827963803125442
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain				7648.702157133284
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				100677.26210226979
first my lord inquired grimaud				345.14251688891824
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned				62778.56693101557
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail				4951.946122948118
the same officer appeared				1045.8360254420618
it was evident he had his orders				3490.4082015708136
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussel s release				62993.74953636449
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step				2074.1054526275575
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding				24528.890056468066

the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cæsar s commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander				22373.1828017307
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry				8021.047433743637
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence				419.7961232832521
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				14238.440677198556
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed				321.457025145031
there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself				196.38901932142082
it is of an original color said aramis i never saw one with such a hide in my life i can well believe it replied d artagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him				29.219824849615872

monsieur d artagnan he cried vade retro satanas so my dear bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so i don t understand you bazin nor can i see how i can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation said d artagnan				144.23324298776583
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased				203952.26505367242
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den set your mind at rest replied athos				64.7797368327006
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck				129083.06163064028
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so do you understand what i mean yes sir				752.0492250876741
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away				548.7374250623789
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me				71.44122774281746
parry bent over his master s hand and kissed it respectfully				27823.46333965885
we will try and carry him on board the tartan dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him				31.281900005162658
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal				55010.344448134216
well be it so said she				118.2275480924484
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way				490.7722014751375

it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family				1247.0145506491567

a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour				1365.3704473384764
let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre d hotel noirmont has purchased the shop of pere marteau well said la ramee shuddering				5073.097262674174
she closed the door after her took the duke by the hand and after a few experimental steps grasped a balustrade put her foot upon the bottom step and began to ascend the staircase				447.40964960415937
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid				2396.2357748246345
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl				1326.4384615593606
and so the good la ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner				873.5837369139783

his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house				409.3787669697993
one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis				117780.56125012122
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world				1177.397870578108
do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you				69.66846045907718

then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed				12872.072032644483
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended				2244.279455434128
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling				684.2981711859983
monte cristo bent his head				429.8324579914571
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all				353.4582687126563
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl				9169.098805747117
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department				13432.611347452517
you have done this i hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees				1115.9047264559442

well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord as we have before said the post chaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration				3067.499025460473
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away				554.2075275607468
but in that same banker s study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry				11289.461791404761

and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth certainly agreeable undeniably witty he has unfortunately too much wit well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man because he is an enemy of whom of the cardinal what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man				130.64655863005976
one step nearer said comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoner s breast one step nearer and i kill the prisoner my orders were to carry him off alive or dead				680.3360195450199
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him				25.654500863201633
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite				22394.422923741167
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light				1147.008829599408
your spanish wine is excellent				4819.212216727525
grimaud made a sign that he was not				374.63007899883235
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest go sir replied the tutor but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger do not fear				1011.8799342927337
well baron said he here i am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker				28697.36826509551
yes replied the man but at what a price listen friend said monte cristo				122.33085700448459
still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his enemies				1266.9312450465989
we shall not interfere with each other your object is a title mine money				983.4900877222517
explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment				374.684924738611
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements				9964.093303077509
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch				1431.6378003081193
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach				2174.145562971923
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears				3693.270765397767
do you think athos will be sorry to see us oh cried porthos oh				706.1009290997229
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony really said franz				575.156348555494
the half pistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket				598.6745750887939
he received yesterday a message from the prince de condé he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not returned have you seen madame de chevreuse she was not at home				2137.502151905981
strength and sagacity continued				2589.7888022051793
but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room				93.22799088312281
at any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in paris is there not in that respect my dear friend it s delightful				4144.559116515925
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion				4320.206426680216
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light				1149.360328700931
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible do not think so brisemont said d artagnan do not think so				220.36171330361088
swords then cried aramis swords				6362.112583734029
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said d artagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle				3755.36879013527
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio				1974.5864472803798
his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy				50797.80796604354
yes my friend a presentation				120800.04042283181
it was quite dark and no one saw them go out				307.274571717697
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham				1742.868073829279
for i am sure the count is his father				988.8140636104373
it was time for the jailer was coming				2680.4901782340394
thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and tears				1001.8705680831198
i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin				5320.7195286526785
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham				1895.4555948316656
i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled				6148.58985477431
yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit				5097.603092218505
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture				5298.257774301447
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated them				82.3803479224577
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur				1368.8110664286721
and m bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him				31.20440119435376
he resides in a quiet quarter continued aramis his tastes and his profession require it				60.158225782596965
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears				999.7140345273109
athos pinched aramis s hand				146.95692026483158
what is this wait your reverence there is a letter you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body				1167.3710534775137
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room				92.56050592903935
no no answered dantès don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner				1012.2510463310261
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis				190.8529031428516
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said tréville				1342.29233937034
my god my god my god she knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating arms				613.8983548471134
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true				654.9323051807172
but what do you expect				13442.38919116923
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her				138.80276523781714
neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more				1657.0206343480907
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions				4253.008805350453
athos arrested				7029.803065340625
instinctively fernand drew back his chair				320.9991896374206
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornélie her confidential maid				11436.544970354951
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthos s opinion is the king accustomed to give you such reasons				167267.15850681305
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night				520.1223555852521
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive d artagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but but what asked anne of austria				1955.284408497667
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated				224974.18902627955
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks				3922.4556983601133
you were writing said monte cristo with a searching look				703.7795366356505
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops				16168.354053054269
d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it				59.55497034473745
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of béthune with milady her mortal enemy				830.8710223458294
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers				6608.878696456736
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family				1144.4285554477678
i don t very well know what but still something monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it				55.966888902988174
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well the messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and retired				1237.6312055998894
and a little bit of a thief oh sir				530.6345745265129
shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future				1761.7172507115233
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain that s useless said d artagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held				5095.03689110505
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections				8426.701796349551
oh that s nothing				967.2706476885694
this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly				4889.117955623443
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set off				1719.7143866393315
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared				1124.6681375970186
i enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make				4242.94566208386
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron				39540.476462438535
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m de tréville s surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground				998.485378798611
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch but will it not be lost oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up a gardener grimaud nodded				19452.956767437452
am i to say what you told me asked valentine				254.80334659123932
to saint peter s first and then to the colosseum returned albert				650.6138102069403
i am not a banker like m danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell				4761.345429809715
what could this treachery be				502.09200440254693
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter				4053.2829951488366
listen to this dilemma god is god and the world is the devil				1300.8417454891846
as for aramis he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king s presence				2459.039514939116
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully				28089.274207786708
today is the				140651.18492602033
the white flag morbleu we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasure s sake				3812.7251390813003
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents				124311.40709268737
the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball				7410.923465712185
and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend worthy caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us yes to be sure i am				1445.4224377895296

i wish them to be promulgated immediately but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no man will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain you are right mr jackson replied buckingham				1785.2610790456624
a woman could go up a ladder like that aramis s searching look seemed to seek his friend s thought even at the bottom of his heart but d artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity				22663.89057825965
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny				4965.86409184198
the steward could not restrain himself				154.74410891001526
we have walked eight paces whispered d artagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery				11582.63892247734

he was charming				3410.151330135863
she did not please she intoxicated				58169.422688875835

the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it				56.475708945599955
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel				63416.95502689005

how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty six years old				1635.178942967968
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window				533.8470664453306
her lips were cold it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue				1044.0731353756157

here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested				7083.465681424414
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed				40803.56346268701
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe				164967.0716645364
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden				2549.6025915113587
but unfortunately i must wait you must wait for what asked caderousse				275.5500188819309
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage				921.129490492842
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said d artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought what monsieur cried d artagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason				3454.9358403917236
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition what that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me don t dream it athos				155.62037502066832
i do not understand you i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him fernand cried mercédès i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken				2828.754482634469
what might be the consequences				16114.261167218461
all hands to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in				565.1800623773963
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given				2194.0968679690445
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him				29.043706967300015
madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the hôtel de ville				21120.81842430539
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa				78957.92984006008
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect				6765.77149707644
did parliament pass this act athos asked of him in english				5903.220262915684

not even me asked the count with deep emotion				3732.962622445433
but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment				119845.22230608725
what the devil				1167.7674526418057
he took to his heels and was soon at m de tréville s but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de tréville s office				3441.6435566634727
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips				410.1010837650463
that can only be to hold gloves he said				352.8274737850756
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there				520.4503330157809
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone				22498.737717368043
at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard				539.8177767967096
but d artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that				625.1184016105722
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex				12682.78584720349

above you there is the king above the king there is god however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him				28.883996496737854
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed				19548.826684714797
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer s dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess who was enormously fond of him				31.65222586441637

a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated				113657.7867280794

well replied la ramee your supper is ordered ah				219.05477310478403
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm				16234.421785617636
he was hungry he supped he went to bed				332.1538479338427
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there				533.8027751702264
certainly not				264.42434485662716
oh sir said she clasping her hands				378.1140701018491

but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans				136438.51864347083
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy				101791.76349485884
is that monte cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy voice				202.83652134555703

aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times				1797.2034258960925
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges				9884.091568284623
what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom				26414.92562656266

but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship				4805.572365810725
the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short				4137.999112118971
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen				10977.857815173023
sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant that s all				412.4172579039108

d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it				47.47128798711911

hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain				34952.19952216976
all doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at rome				890.8782000942027
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round				7552.393328206428
villefort s dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of m de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire				27486.200606134036
will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty s service pardieu they did not scruple much in the case of athos				212.00873237979377

a recollection of athos came into her mind				619.2238239303048
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance				151861.34663065465
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy				1791.8442081032822
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you heyday cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman				17999.127023131867
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear				963.9839802877226
in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a cloak				1782.2849379224565
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow				6275.064163820915
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio				2008.981024073266
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are				893.3603819794542

but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house				407.67834629336966
then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz				591.3331308956857
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated				108129.56186033116
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities				154349.6416116793
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears				3327.9926320544278
we must ask the comte de la fere the question				1338.2481767355225
he then motioned to his wife to take leave				10743.875397655238
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence				459.6088777868947

athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow				1683.8028569485557

but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter				61786.88826315418
first and foremost dear d artagnan we have no title such as count here				656.7426846129824

felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying voice				211.7347436210479
d artagnan obeyed				1807.2494179463995
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders				118731.38478340888
and he is very rich i am not so sure of that and yet you said he had money fifty thousand livres a mere trifle he is well educated hem said monte cristo in his turn				830.5030431813158
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them really said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment				1248.586534271309
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures				31959.56263703006

at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious				65418.73204021287
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree heavens athos a murder cried d artagnan				94.78877555918409
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france				723.982587450504
yes why because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyone s neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom and then they leave her				156.33281608892912

de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror				574.5587812934698
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat				130117.80691559466
here i await thee there was profound silence				458.36268131507785
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now				1743.7026621071009
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off come added the king				526.597038466135
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god amen said d artagnan getting into his saddle				4006.270949670938

as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed				679.3822759514934
they could willingly have strangled m de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus				1378.2002286281067
anne of austria was then twenty six or twenty seven years of age that is to say she was in the full splendor of her beauty				2596.556277932633
on they all set off swift as the wind				4317.60744463775
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m d épinay and the following day the contract will be signed a deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved				4490.697600136166

with two companions he said				303.1655951304094
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse				4465.313466211714
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others				1168.6520413552578
m the epistle is laconic said d artagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter				635.5311447674328
is there any difficulty in the way no replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn the deuce				14291.510369174497

when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now				1723.8892666666022

when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes european crimes if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life				469.8100627474481

the night passed in perfect silence				446.0542146602543

the jailer was right dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad				1983.5089594969213
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison				1979.4706806503063
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses				7787.689462730459
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers				9251.047482344426
bertuccio the steward appeared at the door				186.15881810024638

parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony				8978.941586710927
milady recoiled uttering a cry				8644.496823958043
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her				136.1376798046594

parbleu that s good said albert with a gloomy tone				810.6728099647106
at that moment d artagnan opened his eyes				375.5651611207305

they all four entered the tent they had no plan ready they must think of one				1123.6802011666464
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit				5173.179808150281
as to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary				85098.31379752503
back shouted d artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell				4838.81236788583
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair				321.6801287926071

mazarin disappeared as they rose from table				640.2939795535594
do you understand that s no doubt very fine said porthos but deuce take me if i understand at all porthos my friend you know i am descended on the father s side from the prophets and on the mother s from the sybils and that i only speak in parables and riddles				311194.7764280752
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no				421.57563132700636
answer for i have many things to tell you too indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happened but what is the matter				952.8649930985601
as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day				296.88534590906113
it was useless				4147.722370713999
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son				607.436930702001

what design can i have why then not let me out by the door what would be the advantage of waking the porter ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead i wish what god wills but swear that you will not strike me as i go down cowardly fool what do you intend doing with me i ask you what can i do				931.1594682086006
d artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying				3139.422209082346
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up true monsieur le comte replied d artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him				29.332383661678744
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right yes said caderousse				280.94550146691887
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself				196.3929524752444

you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume				64631.67435145494
peste you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going out no one can reproach you for anything of the kind monsieur bonacieux said the young man you are a model for regular people				844.9978698321621
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god				378.3867802430725
i was promised he should die with me				63.06716849407398
aramis obeyed				1510.6478890018934
you heard m de villefort talking to m d avrigny about the death of m de saint méran and that no less surprising of the countess				1380.9361400919745
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it				51.2526752442307
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird				8113.801605681989
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward				111248.43594988773
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back				1110.8002488514694
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone				929.5389062647558
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii				6201.874647416451
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian s room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still				8773.295403368156
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps				2018.6161943887794
monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter				632.096656688589
my friends will be there i hope that is to say you are invited m danglars and you caderousse and fernand said caderousse with a chuckle fernand too is invited my wife s brother is my brother said edmond and we mercédès and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word				520.7077490040008
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed give that to milady				777.0344420602338
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter				834.2116605008647
for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m de morcerf was so proud				15445.013288985581
the aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of october				84086.75796579124
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear				1068.7490354384336
by the way said athos take some pains with your toilet raoul i want you to be approved i hope sir replied the youth smiling that there s no idea of a marriage for me you know of my engagement to louise athos in his turn smiled also				1276.2579798947693
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything				1054.1974541283857
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary				3489.1967604446286
next morning d artagnan was the first to rise				8367.657767639364
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale				165669.91889914064
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne				8642.46078722336
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m noirtier s room				92.0006160136483
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison				6074.453499899036
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily				3311.5138264380084
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a woman s weakness there are twelve days well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations yes sire				3306.366959932211
but you know him m de morcerf is it that excellent m bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smuggler in fact everything				413.8287069977122
albert at this moment ran in				547.046060618481
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy				15026.475682567836
please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account				1859.5246543625528
there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps francs will you have your supper with us				249.12037906629328
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression				2817.558269482053
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held but on rising from his bed of justice on the twenty eighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever				7067.70956048731
the house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics				83053.39860165869
come answer freely m bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible				585.4251263317043
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment				375.17013190043986
this cost me on your account and mine francs				611.9215218711719
thanks to m morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust ah said villefort this seems to me the truth				1362.9630015563673
the felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves				3017.7279214859354
it seems to me said d artagnan with a thousand livres each i do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word procurator roused porthos				132.42536846755638
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me so much the better so much the better said caderousse				862.4096062370324
i should injure the queen instead of serving her well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously				141468.69252519455
an event took place in the church of st louis au marais				76576.54182123074
the house as i said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see andrea drew the garden the court and the house				409.33250552299563
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity				116722.86354707388
hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them				74.05465276065942
from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven				533.0684324306625
now shall i tell you something added athos coolly				12537.97998460589
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness happy father happy son said the count				175.84289423713514
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria				1736.6967387282602
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo				367.3884569315916
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses				1004.0006347113377
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended				147790.37269753366
how do you mean the receipt of m de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once what though payable at rome certainly it will only cost you a discount of or francs the receiver started back				1103.660554237832
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection				13866.729069506004
this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome				895.1995563204035
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed andrea you speak to me before my servant how can i help that my boy				1477.7859490133505
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents				7034.739046408882
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh				1854.2704702200047
i hear she said that paris is not quiet				20695.344115173426
but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address oh my god				459.11997602675854
now i think no more i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it				55.21495312861449
what do you want sir said the king				407.21555745640177
you are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be riddled				127259.85261465382
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path				21520.738021124886
i have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it hush said d artagnan the some one is coming the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule				37349.40862781812
but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits i have a dreadful headache said albert				342.9541940864465
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom				18001.63333216592
i will summon him hither it is useless he would not come up to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner				1036.3245738195078
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey				82848.98254791251
i have sent for one replied the abbé				442.6304797735915
i am all attention said the abbé				463.9090368895192
i live there during my leave of absence continued maximilian and i shall be together with my brother in law emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply				641.1038839581573
i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing				112795.98993580838
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him				30.86043153976554
villequier said guitant				173853.37661328362
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound ah he ll come round thought d artagnan that s not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to d artagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics				226656.74525708106
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de vaugirard				17075.182205678753
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness				3436.812259861154
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear not at all my good friend how				1102.7042165708122
the next day m noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him				32.364101416963145
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration				257417.88098528923
oh spare me that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same m de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless				4489.554274694031
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love				927.5977774728093
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see d artagnan				145.86370981965936
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them				81.044938378239
we are alone sir said buckingham speak my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson yes sir and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign it here it is my lord give it to me said the duke				1354.8199874545971
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart				309.56275300190106
he had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arms and flee far far away				558.7183202478105
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket				135861.36868644843
raoul he ejaculated				152208.45680350787
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter				1937.2543130544675

well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m noirtier m danglars was there also you recollect m danglars do you not maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them				76.00122903880147
this evening then at nine o clock adieu till then notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the count s hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared				406.9152787101692
the royal procession set out for paris				362.0228822086204

albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you				81.95727089046554
at the end of a year dantès was a new man				126.65174499981163
about what time why about fifteen or eighteen days ago exactly so and yesterday evening he came again yesterday evening yes just before you came my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies				91377.64973215587

a fine and white stocking a silken robe a lace kerchief a pretty slipper on the foot a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty but they make a pretty woman beautiful without reckoning the hands which gain by all this the hands among women particularly to be beautiful must be idle				155124.67160237776
to night we stop at derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it				52.768893498427
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover				22587.118396055706
beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in puddles of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole left hand corner of the cellar and a tun the cock of which was left running was yielding by this means the last drop of its blood				1473.8436931770138
and me too said aramis				18.76178002465127
i present my letter from the queen to the superior and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seek not into lorraine not into belgium but to paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle				2536.5849123845364
yes your french husband				1609.4947281195257
that great man who was so revered by d artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back				1095.895050338576
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great				22798.837712486347
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest				3977.0884390637975
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue				6488.17561971077

what are you waiting for said caderousse				205.99487616013545
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king be easy said aramis i will take two poniards and give one to parry				27361.39692776269
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here				648.5657545185296
my dear albert one word for i must give poor lucien a respite				19496.52797882269

you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me				63.99286001641192
are you all here he asked				824.8179984508757
albert could not understand the banker s look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can i tell you because i imagine you have correspondents in that country monte cristo smiled significantly				176286.44080211723
what is there astonishing in that and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me no so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel for you alone the deuce				14717.228617025467
is that what you would say he has some but he is very avaricious that is his fault				14928.63262580011
hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord				682.1447316379346
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all				405.32190851010193
the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers				1054.137134191984
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m de villefort s door and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon				14969.063560084758
that s a match you are playing with his eminence this letter is your game				9042.574921413561
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving d artagnan how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man				73.8654811684644
i begin and without any rhetoric allow me porthos said aramis				19.809520639371563
the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom				6821.613425217738
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg™ depends upon and can not survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment				5660.6904709472765
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory				1455.307264724598
and yours i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor franz d épinay started with surprise				1658.2086239077123
you are going already he said				249.24478309469575
la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner				3306.953506641061
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good bye mercédès we shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas				71808.21131698947
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place				459.4252595758965
come come murmured d artagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort				2011.5221733454875
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water				1300.0839722955382
stay here is another louis for you then that will make only louis more said peppino with the same indifference				9785.703644594993
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert				680.2393523839957
chapter lxi				14592.312971159368
besides germain was in the interests of the queen and if anything should happen mme				171.53949602228957
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming and the two friends began to laugh				789.276599341587
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety				7547.439617319556
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris				386.1634329004679
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy				19235.346213141216
the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will				724.5368805185823
at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word				562.4960486867817
from seven o clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged				165976.39662537453
who goes there				516.5378222182447
the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them				71.44524762408712
this house in past years did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing				3403.510361771041
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday				4130.97277146741
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself				723.9953607697681
i feel if this continues said mme				50.70846519765067
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied bazin				9363.676106899607
the thing is simple enough				1358.743173648033
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times i shall do so if only in gratitude eh cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder				11596.974533257595
there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer				136155.67564787052
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column				17623.7603114736
come collect yourself and tell me all i have related it but once and that was to the abbé busoni				3819.3376567385976
will this be permitted me certainly replied the officer and left the room				90.25584445105186
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land				3027.433484537853
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind				688.3730018543815
we have had great annoyances there				523.6004199398434
you are not wrong after all and life is sweet				134771.56557433723
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy				14948.392484783299
as soon as he arrives inform me				27.608134733103377
d artagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber				7263.176509796386
nay that he can almost work a miracle				20176.24112505104
and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker				130222.5810452601
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano				66896.74881670767
barrois made some steps towards his master				1008.011890558751
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton				107384.92733956288
for us also inquired athos				12.316309249186013
nay said caderousse one can t always work one is not a dog so much the better for the dogs said monte cristo				221.17798578322902
at half past seven the retreat was sounded				2078.3169735244496
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father				987.3195856850064
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who was that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count				206.18847231739792
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton				1144.1317298509057
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued				2329.143410801185
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it i agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations				26562.351560195377
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could				2989.632788530554
is this carriage for us asked milady				135.1724487062433
who has paid me this attention my mistress sir				654.7177929256796
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons				12953.508187934218
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				1670.4827239872525
what cried d artagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos yes that disturbs you by no means and here is the second d artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis				139.80805188557343
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion				7087.540310434424
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage i do not think that is the case however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed				1878.9078375751933
it was already too late				3629.7375578266415
i own i was seeking them why when all was arranged listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable did you doubt it no the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it well well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind have you succeeded asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope				1518.194878981187
oh do not fear the scaffold madame said the magistrate i will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself no if you have heard me distinctly you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold no i do not understand what do you mean stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed				18036.964740618427
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted				3617.145425727897
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword				1157.9093307962944
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors				27610.125305468413
d artagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before				1233.54234394777
the youths spurred on				883.4304104427515
i am at quite a loss how to answer you i admit said mme				67.1332108636985
that woman that woman which the one with a white dress and so many diamonds the fair one madame danglars i do not know her name but it is she sir it is she whom do you mean the woman of the garden she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end				1071.1157758587312
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith				2097.4659062000196
i shall be gone only a few moments villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace				4962.682642344272
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots				29889.87171541187

no time was to be lost				595.5704534084656
how can such enormous jars have been manufactured ah				281.10469727586604
one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges				75654.08928463445
swear my son the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said i swear to your majesty henry said charles call me your father father replied the child i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king good my child				1061.4219899538386
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue				13436.826609395992
besides even you didn t recognize me they will be much less likely to that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you				61.6668812976591
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs				606.2609390240058
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say yes sire you will accept his judgment undoubtedly and you will submit to the reparation he may require certainly la chesnaye said the king				444.80468209115315
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles				9481.91600904144
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears				1007.3516834179263
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity				7215.986449934212
well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs i				1197.9162306863648
he can not make me forget what i shall have lost thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on				923.8955056610899
but what s going on in the city yonder said athos				10.691689758367454
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon for if he s a coward he will disgrace thee some day monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammont s regiment and i refused to accompany him monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said d artagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong here s a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him i will cut out thy tongue				6464.020965151585

any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg™ license as specified in paragraph e				2227.670331855323
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised				14114.102209943947
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing				3772.3003026013243
a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict				96222.3302393994
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan they attracted his admiration				2957.9179535861867
bonacieux entered				766.8868207932774
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here ah				292.69679091965224

buckingham saw by the expression of the young man s face what was passing in his mind and he smiled				298.73797193372
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti yes said morrel smiling it was the of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some heroic action interrupted château renaud				2282.532405252807
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle				30759.138415561585
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened				8466.357662473527
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated				45498.26784674635
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table				624.2349221725844

d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen				65640.39756060584
he asked what was going on				884.6402326095755
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready				1733.6858174995166
everything was as athos had foreseen				9981.383832495092
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event				2606.515071043805

all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house				408.2372292646475

ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality				55660.3283326336
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room				93.06267771399743
the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the guard				2534.569413790105

of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story				3770.5666839492187
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus				156128.71032976182
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject				2846.069912612753
selim made ready his lance				32308.056308107465
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart				316.7551632798745
i always had a desire to have a mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out i went to the bey and proposed to give him for ali a splendid double barreled gun which i knew he was very desirous of having				379173.0392051758
what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsar s commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six o clock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker s at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist				5040.261484562058
debray perhaps as it was once proposed				15290.468969376068
alas yes well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress and what sort of revenge would you take i would triumph over her and supplant my rival i will never help you in that monsieur chevalier said kitty warmly				7388.855977984382
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback				4375.348176320785
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod				27860.71619125309
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point				1372.0693002311905
that same night the general was to go over to the english				3886.5749943339238
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress				1098.2334002676828
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments				21669.57566446558
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves				2459.7067929027526
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute a branded woman				980.7607560976522
it is he who has raised all this revolt the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal the queen sprang to the window				527.7284579430509

the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face				319.5986538476255
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true				652.7782019678532
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church				4577.980551533532
the valet entered				863.2571540638909
the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon which he reached as she rounded into la réserve basin				20181.57174204932
ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero				20961.81174546015
you see we were quite right to pacify that country yes but don carlos well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time about what about the papers my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers then you will dispute the more m				754.2211986042817
arrived at ryston d artagnan assembled his friends				294.55937469403904
if i made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith				124912.97119143879
why did you talk of a regiment athos				169.27216672642902
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town				5375.635262056492
gentlemen said de winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at paris let us separate to avoid suspicion				3562.6870909855425
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key				7250.961159198373
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness				2271.5638651645527
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself				872.2700711476496
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited				12733.044154487201
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him				30.872279710986955
the figure put the comb in its pocket				607.3929057254956
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead				675.4685570047839
stop in the name of heaven monsieur porthos cried she				134.86502502403025
and you say that by his will he leaves me five hundred thousand livres are you sure of it he showed it me but that is not all there is a codicil as i said just now probably and in that codicil he acknowledges me oh the good father the brave father the very honest father said caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands				393.9454711115084
i have nothing but memory				1456.3735540392715
you lose ground you are turning				103506.23413974982
they continued to admire it but said no more about it and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another subject				2836.0720287559666
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding				148655.3296032746
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me				49.803729768450545
you are the king of lackeys				14026.252448251005
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape				1032.4103461589877
i understand my game kitty i have this one safe what will you do with him madame what will i do with him				30.518259779666668
my orders asked grimaud				313.19908619699356
cries of despair resounded on all sides				6122.078513742611
grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy				2984.932113494019
is the deed of sale ready yes count have you brought it here it is very well and where is this house that i purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary				2089.8446433070712
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches				34541.30445719586
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing				1039.5931373847234
m danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end am i indeed so happy said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow				1702.915149288891
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination				11650.616278008907
then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees				4392.837262018339
the carnival at rome				962.6936501984167
the officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck				1444.4130667849395
the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street door				199.35731782593263
about forty leagues only				5887.449918116842
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant				189235.63298229277
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him				25.129888454988727
i am lost said d artagnan to himself				166.20455041022385
two remained with the men in black who rummaged every place and took all the papers				3901.3140761057275
athos and d artagnan went out while planchet was sent to inquire if there were not three horses for sale in the neighborhood				5452.270586005629
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit				8432.75532545338
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos				81.09356867202622
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps				3991.146761804722
but d artagnan had reckoned without the wind				4355.73488024481
the snow was falling thick and icy				101067.83181682555
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto				1922.6973268234742
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory				34986.78295671309
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering				6384.7050670612925
what more need be said				288.8831556704283
no doubt m danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs				649.120804783226
if i take you you will be hung the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud				18475.33811966209

the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation				15640.090076308805
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer				1246.8480673584831
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite				120660.83917700134
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers				1026.9779741783836
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying				73377.45403251209
it was a quarter past midday				47417.811005661126
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them				79.72680417278481
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god				377.64666404486644
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them but i am unable to leave london for want of money				1011.2413033232967
we are about to have the honor of charging you replied aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other				756.4160363728773
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property				4128.70024605635
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours				1063.7933019613965
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos				10.93996585732622
there placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland but still on english soil the tents of a little army extended				13254.003533806435
ah it is certainly you he cried				1836.420364341548
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis				26808.264404087757
it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times to other places which very likely have no connection with the present time and place				465.1929380132342
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheard of piece of intelligence some telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that henri iv				1039.8568920886617

when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son				608.9943362535217
my god				323.1574259133759
the soldier went out leaving the dinner served				13131.660300509831
ah said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds				35743.653159175556
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged				119431.28268982655
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse				10295.850521730199
but let us be quick the king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l evêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in m de tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort l evêque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him				31.41760433456251
bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of béthune				4273.736564841524
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him				31.5153127569394
only d artagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that man s hat upon which is written the name of the village of ah said d artagnan i comprehend				14468.940518659947

listen said m de tréville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend you will do me honor monsieur said d artagnan				36.9204941616337
but you expected some one then asked the officer				2445.0754135532443
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me well be it so				343.4656166041018
oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist				191964.5052405572
he followed him				27.133816007675755
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made				2612.794211022971

the abbé the abbé murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering				123245.70854815072
he had fainted				3274.9911133027017
my lords answered he it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me				73.55877421624794
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard monseigneur said m de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen				109133.22152478925

the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend				58566.3608527072
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen				424.2959688796068
d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task				3536.317523305908
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine				1840.840821697329
good thought d artagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable				17425.182866102212
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature and he withdrew sighing				21405.845853108443
sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london				2239.430474455869
in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his ordinaries had been to henry iii and his scotch guard to louis xi				4301.980709780556
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended				3904.079448928704
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison				1796.1916252628373
come back sirs back the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard				550.9176962124253
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice				12055.61085209675
put back that weapon d artagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated				29464.12912662553
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head				456.569598669451
rue du helder may half past ten in the morning now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself shall i see you again ere my departure asked albert				701.420287553075
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant				2077.2717116716076
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed				321.61571184711016

oh beautiful life				373.571363989048
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o clock				1295.6825093770792
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt				11276.441876582961
you are brave monsieur d artagnan continued his eminence you are prudent which is still better				1018.1127116848572

yes monseigneur said d artagnan				4.910351602090962
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride				4090.456972633722
move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded				7835.710837043359

but what has become of m d épinay replied morrel				188.56968510925233
look that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lackey in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to him				29.783051648346657
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground				1036.9058666714632
i am ready to speak my lord ah				217.00419126479247
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose				4598.0595829858485
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care and what is her name haydée replied monte cristo				147.6601133387312

i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him				31.32512765945392
but were you not on horseback				4537.063893113936
besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on that this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible				6517.751520559296
are the oars in the boat everything is ready tis well mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match				38921.667263280324
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon				2483.71712695843
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham london the letter shall be given to himself generous girl cried anne of austria				2196.926642564753
faria smiled				302.0510626167825
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your love a second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman				1014.1787684326962
charge cried porthos				23.278203315210533

halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers				2610.8936937045096
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis				200.46709524384423
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion				20489.593173787434
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread				20167.31501490572
i wish to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf				29436.015265513404
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light				1180.6800480260617
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness				2282.04485580356
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone not even before you philip				395137.7010973659
uncertainty is worse than all go on with the lights said the inspector				2198.5258256880074
everything goes on capitally my dear monsieur bernouin but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place where then sir where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked we have that sir replied bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison				1938.4463233768838
i hear my brother				1516.1215077112952
no his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite				12496.509582267796
but what detains her				93.11492262277
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before				1259.3535649655857
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak				1642.26939703141
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post				2963.2825040772404
gentlemen cried the surrounding group				16293.998546285964
you will take your place in the coupé to châlons				136818.2095736308
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat				2391.8658369563177
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino				2483.035047348937
there is the subject simplified				103352.26053623694
but pardon me are you free				21816.966582561665
take care of the executioner d artagnan all right				1125.1621632264807
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him				31.229125697572034
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room				91.83712891118688
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell and are you going to leave me at such a time this very instant and where are you going ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service ah me				61.59834680842719
just as they were sitting down to table m de monte cristo arrived				2435.7380837543283
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence				24639.904349137494
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city				2106.0707940897196
five minutes after m de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour				1309.9907865409348
is supper ready signor pastrini yes your excellency well then let us sup but the carriage and horses said franz				606.3268546125461
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris				375.23131899981064
let us see what porthos has found for supper and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were				1931.1864527073244
stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms				622.1699170363493
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study				870.8279847195101
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber				6885.1221247410795
come and open then cried d artagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle				30443.693681829875
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted				286438.464066186
now for the wager				156176.06641947065
this point settled the duke turned to d artagnan				9.345411313062787
do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open particularly in the night				522.6899092240202
i foresee in it the aid of powerful princes with the enmity of the government counteracted by parliament and insurrections that may be done if they can separate the king from his mother that may be done said aramis				153.40793345148094
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence				1364.7559856043767
what are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust i did not send for you i think baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter				619.6077925338759

noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old man s eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child				1057.7326885038374
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her				108.04435607744205
monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around				1410.276604723288
and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown				14432.420244850746
the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleurs de lis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak				4705.604810768832
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you				80.6884494948819
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something				4327.137818664794
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count				257.52810616130296
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended				13344.204784063355
but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us is not death in my house oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture				2558.18313893998

and now you are assembled gentlemen said d artagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis				190.89076529245935
send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall judge only replied tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution				118767.28445952994
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment have you no friends who could assist you morrel smiled mournfully				523495.8679815992

he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london				2260.933711291494
you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done i shall abide by that rule grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it				60.50782604020791
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest				1993.7728800578632
that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance the englishman smiled imperceptibly				21987.659786890636

you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich even				87178.36236067198
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache				11473.688069227803
that is not all sir continued mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from mr cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can i do for you mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this moment mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make				3605.6765493837643
but the dead can not return their fire certainly not				376.3674150827057
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars				61071.35898087798

adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				183.44038618843555
villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his brow				1675.4366195419434
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count				224.65931822802108
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young				3594.370865936706
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out				391.598755214145

yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife				881.455683055237
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled				297.72956927500536
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans				7820.138246016718

he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it				59.74519948874461
during this time in the kiosk at my father s feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats				93103.16612358038
some wine said athos on perceiving the host				911.1358613251737
oh i can not go without taking leave of her i can not die without confiding her to someone he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness				1394.735953665312
bravo count bravo it is frank at least said morrel				186.92565730242893
have we relations with the court				1480.0715282598394
what said monte cristo				81.17802579738971
he probably had succumbed				15143.578787203445
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him				30.838961884473953
beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things				1565.3437229613523
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind franz smiled an instant after the count entered				914.4633957299799
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day				295.249544231784
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls				24087.308096652498
fire then said athos				11.608223860678908
this reassured her				91.00898107079489
it was mercédès leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house				403.5569321514404
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saint méran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy				833.5873747163822
consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger i beseech of you maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern				112714.37336329921
ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him alas sighed bazin				5754.649876359676
as you please said athos				11.168383573270123
he had sighed deeply therefore when accepting the gift of the pony from m d artagnan the elder				117017.5533620534
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude				135038.78316806056
the soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along				19212.044789123865
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut i wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover again that accusation cried the queen				319.730961400467
albert rejoined his mother she was very pale				860.2541747745214
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells				73146.54020268851
selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your duty selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath				87738.7720040956
i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when she complains hold your tongue woman it is the will of god and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance				4514.3356550835315
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it				62.94507110164505
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog i like the means well enough said d artagnan but where and how to meet with her time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man				121.97537493135778
what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m de morcerf begging me to attend the opera and i said debray				757.4721439170486
i call on you where are you				68.98384961402508
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing				1061.645214744846
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same				1022.4786897574014
i monseigneur replied milady				133.6372719420235
that is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life				409.30108195247743
athos began to despair				1019.8906114908335
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband but how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since you are the ship s supercargo why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden				133319.36602196947
and clement vii but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work				1112.1034733260362
luigi vampa if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him				29.020408250595874
it remains here said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly				12032.30573758399
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to you there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching				12028.89817460613
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality				4840.432381540217
february said he it is the day my father was murdered valentine and villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly go on but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared noirtier s eye continued to say read he resumed the undersigned louis jacques beaurepaire lieutenant colonel of artillery étienne duchampy general of brigade and claude lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the of february a letter arrived from the island of elba recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club general flavien de quesnel who having served the emperor from to was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the napoleon dynasty notwithstanding the title of baron which louis xviii				1226.9662265750992
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a gilt headed screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons				12472.982579022688
no but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing				2011.7552647991292
a man of fifty can not long bear malice with a wife of twenty three				13049.427701462066
that s well				464.92394660260095
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever				2186.4257726203427
flee alone flee alone and leave you here				479.28324852320867
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i can not believe it the thing is impossible i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true is what true madame inquired danglars visibly agitated				3572.97298608156
and wherefore should they do so				211.8579543079459
you must have had enough for today				3681.816831210054
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse				462.89877067660234
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers				2979.286852153265
you will hear again from me come come thought d artagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good school the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word the queen standing near the door d artagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away				554.160225832561
the son of a shipowner really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish a mineral water cure at auteuil well i m sure said morcerf this is indeed news				11361.340502759089
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				1255.3737042601188
really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned				10070.054480472827
but devil take him				25.16110521591169
jussac fell like a dead mass				9423.365455470108
she descended and went through the passage				2916.6177865343943
what do you mean beauchamp oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain				14099.034770667196
it was her first and on what an occasion				4798.5701402734985
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries				17038.27338813024
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently				27201.15589768665
i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure				6056.567771733965
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist observed debray				602.9926814860346
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king s wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them				79.03702701506447
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below				1085.9143515178966
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part				4824.808745826957
while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to albert s while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard				550.9019345561787
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter				4059.046701935367
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber				411.82201723218867
let me see what time it is danglars watch one of breguet s repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five				5331.0251160114
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaunt yes they would have all been blown up just so				338.6607455112395
m morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted				28467.28279019813
in a couple of hours he returned				1844.0985139143902
you don t know them				89.52733782830316
then there was the ring with the lion s head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand				159.4352856513598
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband				1652.4702198505192
holà mousqueton seats and order double the bottles do you know what we are eating here said athos at the end of ten minutes				2559.0444886826267
now gentlemen said d artagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs				8708.990220390726
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the cask				40323.611074178305
respect to fallen majesty				2902.649254914716
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				20343.81526634406
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have but what the devil				1257.7368388972075
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments				10421.706170452851
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold				3150.3813187860937
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near				2744.302173970489
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others				1143.138142965897
in ten minutes the masters slept not so the servants hungry and more thirsty than hungry				13709.856739814393
the count opened the letter and read m				462.5827970243697
as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal				353.71707544312125
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought				1317.8461354113726
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is you think so				263.79428167208033
the audience m de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent				1602.9408938054487
fatality he muttered				7194.211260636171
it was in the name of comte de wardes				7171.3116794366915
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it				54.60955430291708
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes				365.568259477159
an instant after porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon and m de tréville alone remaining with the wounded				3241.463773461768
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie said he				17.259614662975107
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy				468942.3733030475
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche				3412.233356648006
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way				497.26953076487234
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness				1688.5401941055002
on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire				1734.749261487317
la ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes i will go in your stead i will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition i will return to prison monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud well i am wrong				3457.886020058952
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study				863.253449374047
then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air				698.4938355953662
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still yes we				18289.966227775712
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house				405.4641820688476
i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company ah				292.10589599555686
bertuccio remained standing before him				26.173810252431657
my dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word i will blow out your brains but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon so much the better they must be good animals then sir i shall call my people and i mine i ve ten guards behind me don t you hear them gallop				1066.7572632116562
at least d artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking				25864.370469824888
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself				189.86242741334098
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation				89229.31266420493
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips				396.32155721842304
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it no madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features				4261.729991291872
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street				1242.3388992379973
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp is it not it is absurd said debray				607.8530083836234
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours				11434.342021232516
planchet met them hard by the shed				8617.334274172588
my god				323.1574259133759
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune				1492.777794970608
upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom house officers and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed				34622.071626687946
it is true he had been playing the day before playing the day before				1261.44145365752
madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend i am indeed most wretched replied mercédès				3106.8293828058786
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one				1189.4296790253236
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman				1004.2012488266721
i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot				1952.918598527103
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others m de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree				73595.33908760715
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time				326.52344053285213
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne				12722.411173391742
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said groslow				1892.3977171651404
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris				387.2380762965523
i bought some spanish shares				24437.29244699654
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner				1362.4646106540235
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle				6948.228062308669
i suffered that is all yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves				2536.9102989588
let us talk like men he said looking at the count				176.68236979293286
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets				2710.556203371403
we need no proofs everything relating to this young man is true a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay				11697.308681199738
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark				6263.877395559411
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine d avrigny took the priest s hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentine s room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers				111626.030048957
and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my honor				622.018631827458
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you yes sir answered raoul				581.8492620884485
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise				10741.283432381559
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man				125.3963535726431
he dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away				528.0378148022746

thank you said monte cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going nonsense say on well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together what is it a telegraph				43612.69520590201
no said felton it is nothing but what then is the noise that of the patrol going their rounds where is their road just under us they will discover us no if it does not lighten but they will run against the bottom of the ladder fortunately it is too short by six feet here they are				876.9321761404454
at eight o clock all were in their places and m de morcerf entered at the last stroke				34673.84979472673
milady saw the trouble				8690.12388644244
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars				340.3927368980312
d artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos s pleasant dwelling place				467.90057419345453
and i was ready to strangle you cried the duke				858.4749238950968
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed				8803.022929880799
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns				2730.6810030733736
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat				1317.0068630346273
i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account				1968.1050778856063
yes that is my name you said then by the word of bonacieux				5296.060256774142
my friend				189.33264186128523
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak				1810.906992111972
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful				7787.570632926265
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly				256294.5092571601
this movement was observed by mordaunt				1937.7790768655836
pardon me for quitting you my dear madame bonacieux said he but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend				268.6566939350877
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				230573.67679525027
porthos drew back a step				1950.7044723479505
who occupies number the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish				10056.71438656049

by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door				197.68530682641284
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it				42.61175993554798
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expected one is weak				10799.55334747685
i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration nothing more simple returned the count				255.55203204467944
then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther				32911.70575740756
sinbad the sailor he said				287.4113374168987
morrel shook his head				416.5171284960734
the devil take this gout cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at ease				9842.768873902389
the young lady went towards madame morrel				422.012680534137
well picture to yourself a future more gloomy still certainly frightful perhaps sanguinary the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat				1307.8287770855711
now if you marry m cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive				274846.41862644546
you will put yourself at the head of the first				1035.2231870169808
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out monsieur de gondy				1543.0959872934523
i have made him a spy upon his wife the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and retired				1229.3602971167709
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere yes sire replied athos				19.884004396896017
as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre				18083.74427344856
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses				27543.824417275348
let her alone said he				21.08316360741164
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest				3487.4801632595013
the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity				4629.034207753703
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie				2555.249894585444
a black satin stock fresh from the maker s hands gray moustaches a bold eye a major s uniform ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted				9063.243576167717
you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo then who are you i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dantès danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate				13414.458567235597
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste				10575.309950579447
you are pale and agitated sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly				2757.452146416966
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted				3313.05534068934
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude				1396.008131915153
is there anything new in the wind nothing i thought perhaps that the king s death has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here what have you come for then to embark with you ah				273.43226839280976
good morning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian did you doubt it said the young captain				1365.1549636946643
god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you ah i recognize you i recognize you exclaimed the king s attorney you are i am edmond dantès you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe				89364.29134407896
what is the matter madame said mazarin uneasily				4610.26180302204
then remarking the strange expression of milady s countenance she said pardon me madame you know him by what title why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of friend you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress it is you who have been his mistress madame cried milady in her turn				846.0090136973737
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him				29.84526302127469
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinated i care very little about that				601.3663126781416
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king				543.2031874903197
then all the members looked at each other with terror				566.1114084520387
sometimes when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of parisians all fully armed appear at vincennes to deliver him from prison				1987.9649427402
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract				44748.99018342374
do you not know him i have not that honor you have never heard his name never well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children now then albert cried franz here is a bandit for you at last i forewarn you signor pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin				10654.574219760241
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart oh				962.4737912658137
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed				33916.077371755935
the matter was arranged as d artagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions				1014.6508700475092
they won t devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos				113.1745084642482
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis				78.06829336954306
d artagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it				62.93261629624714
my faith				1675.316787262069
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned i was going out sir then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society no i prefer listening to you here my dear m andrea we can chat better in doors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also				1277.0627594018272
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him				28.42048059667444
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration				3119.485950239086
so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday				4134.070459987719
the instant she appeared the door keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m de villefort s office				3198.9277219394758
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain				27326.89651833556
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness				157217.6438147013
this one will not oppress you by his dignity tis the same thing you understand me d artagnan a court there s no court now				1716.0560573898963
i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us he assured me that they were two noble steeds well madame said porthos if he owed you more than five crowns your horsedealer is a thief there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife seeking to excuse herself				912.531121708468
one opposite to me the other with his back to me good				2936.112843932941
and whose horses are these cried d artagnan				4.372363239047628
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne so near as that said the count but that is not in the country				4886.456320809224
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with				1511.3215505627122
he was a brave and an honest man and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars				330.9523133502043
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos				201.72824746611815
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed				165451.55564606664
i often think of that young man d artagnan strange				21124.242906846746
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet				5931.566333872821
as to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut				6255.955310854019
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men				871.9573472715078
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris				389.3395296755492
those wretches wanted to take away my sword				1268.2930585457232
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion i suffer from emotion said monte cristo				247.9872143104653
besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france				688.6471383504202
d artagnan therefore followed mme				109.74083579050098
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a question				1351.7702942854326
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting				18762.005483600995
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched francs then these francs said mercédès shuddering				5527.5571884658275
they heard the guard going its rounds				332044.7716183065
silence d herblay cried athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these				3158.0489465153346
the lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in advance				15613.280002942092

as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am				1442.6303058346903
who are these gentleman three of the king s musketeers				2460.786078850889
breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat alone she a woman with a few bags of gold milady compared herself mentally to judith the terrible jewess when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke				153292.85230464453
arrest the prime minister of king charles i				1047.4290670731314
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep				846.3891098958418
happy beyond measure well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health d artagnan almost leaped with joy				905.6840802545104

one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its light they examined the weapons				12021.730528915845
i am replied the latter gravely				5671.730265984346
begone begone at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room				92.84903224444243
i have only one thing to say to you				50.62867464475575
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep				20058.538797951463
there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile				244456.49577774582
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine				880.3039438849526
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression				2696.5379990101596
morbleu you must know something about it				42.386321117699026
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face				326.1339596371651
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them				83.55193752881964
it is impossible said the procureur				6460.064522021296
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france				743.7956538832458
his heart failed him				25.518781026718
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery nevertheless he did return				2507.4165706929966
they went to find porthos and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a horse				938.1932897905391
have you anything to ask of me				62.126481122229166
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman i presume that she has returned to tours to tours				11278.72196630388
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowling piece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree				19615.384145988406
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered milady s apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends				12038.641550436916
it is my will morrel				315.454060090531
the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study and m andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jack in the box				884.8933664196607
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres				9415.630977941622
let us visit this one first added he				311.11522011844414
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret				16836.07817441805
i mean spinach replied aramis but on your account i will add some eggs and that is a serious infraction of the rule for eggs are meat since they engender chickens this feast is not very succulent but never mind i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you i am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis but if your body be not greatly benefited by it be assured your soul will and so aramis you are decidedly going into the church				4493.850746551722
i will profit by the advice and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me nothing the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions				18165.883257753172
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m de villefort even would not have alarmed him				29.704534905658143
besides it doesn t concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon ah that is true said athos				35.15865992011467
you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter				944.0896756956007
charles smiled				295.97463608462647
that is not an answer replied athos				8.645695584867935
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table				657.773787343199
in fact a moment later m morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own				710.366219841391
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards i will do more than i promise said dantès				288.98069929278574
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law				1736.1163225416217
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child				1066.3453204742423
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him				29.523777939832595
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest				823.4602523103176
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man				124.80960038267258
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable				213723.42451529283
excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind you do not wish me to marry m franz d épinay observed valentine				781.4296941427795
two hours after all was over we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different religion well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent fellow				2083.415070502247

then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d artagnan who having seen all was coming to him				30.665007007239502
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet				71012.91945157341

half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to ali s finger				1058.9383060411278

upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i don t know anything about that replied renée but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand				2438.457394571079

athos as a diplomatist				10297.559150038813
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred				4452.513897114474
but d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him				28.476688573913595
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive i indeed				904.6788277074133

it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				11168.17695201217
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially				122232.15267745672
listen hermine i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked				281794.94401137705

it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot wait said caderousse we shall see he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcanti s hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself				187.02355107012283
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you who is it it is monsieur d artagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise				1600.240458505951

well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now i did you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune				1457.0737309474614
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him				30.338091262735606

father and son m noirtier for it was indeed he who entered looked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents				88650.08231048881

he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when d artagnan returned				1799.8499924888044

the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them				82.10786813087317
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers				2645.179266835179
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows				2044.0984904511245

in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again speak on madame speak on queen said buckingham the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words				621.6971987767402
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect				24257.89803987993
a dungeon				8557.672684349229

after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet				115481.55204217431
at length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed horrible said the monk				10418.16851780881

horrible replied raoul especially in expression yes yes said de guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor				16871.438753927578

d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung				53600.296733572104
that is agreed upon				2060.875307069402
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair				1012.5160717420298
so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction				2606.5200425815037

he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir				10805.487348983768
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door				185.88552641245454
he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe				124602.08171092295

pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abbé busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris not having seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait nay said danglars it is my fault i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you				75.31663673699732
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly				2069.8550902303978

dying in the arms of his children he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two years				1396.0999971976119

long life to the great cardinal the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m bonacieux and then when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city				2145.766801445041

but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur d artagnan you can not think so dear love replied d artagnan but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from the moment he deceived me he merited death he shall die then since you condemn him said d artagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion				20900.749179156828

he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty s command				6714.169876997449
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o clock				1284.130242484494

yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renées the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count				249.06859207359207

she with a still smiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone				1326.4473165209688
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets				2375.473535048681
what do you mean other men may have entered before them and waited for them we can find out said grimaud				541.9876760384135

to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening				696.635130063402
the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirty five				5371.489437885914

there was no time to lose				2509.3231284187596
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room				93.32788933276198
go on aramis go on all at once a tall dark gentleman just like yours d artagnan the same perhaps said he				183.81908946536217

he bowed with great friendship to the count				245.63885323731026

as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she does not love the english but an englishman well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved				4278.977117603809
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said d artagnan to the youth				2160.9902363474926

aramis he cried				1804.8966124369776
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said d artagnan shaking his head				467.2787273536449
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the king s attorney				6217.105589739808

he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute				149692.71036531078
for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servants a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud				269646.61670799664

yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic				11728.373087982483

there was a moment of frozen silence between these two				1559.3927083387728
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe				85466.5015682875
by this smile m de tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the point				1392.3603826553308
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary				1939.9276549186839
on arriving in paris d artagnan found a letter from m de tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers				2633.95972382807
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so				272.41015807206134
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly				43413.63258843244

the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day				293.4844580823034
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head				457.3863028967329
m bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an instant				2090.4496158120614
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality				4796.698809558927

first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you				67.03900283671406
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i don t know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of what the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs				15907.549753587848
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded				105938.88770816782
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame and by whom				15258.829368495813
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him				30.345875146247383
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied d artagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm				320277.72179404943
sure of himself convinced of his own power certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him he went straight to the object he aimed at even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it				59.27890185575291
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you				72.1974781800711
yes continued mme				95.74947578334937
she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed				3681.715006247785
he thought of that young and pretty mme				152.8879842919666
well suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries				158352.67678494347
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place we might be off during the time if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queen s service not at all said d artagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost you are right sir always right said anne of austria				1902.8124987193873
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london				2271.960338537569
during the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished				11299.155773796414
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends				335.5622028080319
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort				1843.8145106793866
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is half past eleven o clock haydée will soon be here				681.0150228181396

monsieur said he as long as i hold him in this manner he can t cry i ll be bound but as soon as i let go he will howl again				249.0309463632707
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety				510419.98133515887

each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance				5503.671113716844
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor				892.8037898733386

there were two doors he bolted them both				8847.098654769034
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent				1809.3265994449014
he had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house ready for him				31.387289770277
he went to him				26.590006760867436
have you any letters for me inquired d artagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief				1293.2523961259922
ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse				3795.329852467025
are you waiting for him underneath these windows				2041.651504548264

each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea				1043.3733888376655
if you know a prayer say it for you are condemned and you shall die at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed her				144.9271348985449
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening				3089.017294455556
hush we are flying i did not understand				2047.2531088216501
of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly				3720.686506640097

m de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist				9720.835621973249
m cavalcanti remained master of the field				23951.928716434075
m de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant				2505.64885822817
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror				564.5349810397255
monsieur d artagnan is not with me he serves under monsieur dessessart well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company that same evening m de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning				698.2580633826025
to wait replied athos				9.528985554992996

emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors				7684.696774730508

however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead				143030.80092027684
she was poisoned on my account that s all you know of him asked mazarin				377.8123702741782
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction				12038.285646457114
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel				503.9778266385895
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock				14697.718259595416

i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed				1583.8604490398047
he thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to advance				15291.810583964378
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman				186720.51435625527
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change				7702.026670422334
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin				492.42715564766803
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating				56063.87904825535
well my faith				1743.0209963614807
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips				409.2579516628605
can this be another vengeance of that woman it was now athos who turned pale				897.5247131419804
as i told you it is an old family jewel and you sold it asked d artagnan hesitatingly				97540.5782842374
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal				150392.5711531032
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time				313.0756022624375
my uncle answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my family cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed				28831.18009791731
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered d artagnan				13.138661446388445

he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him				32.10381366107462
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth				102798.53594027668
ever since valentine s dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad				14125.386413572001
what have you done with monsieur de bruy				380962.5052287327
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud				12468.082734482585
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty				1974.819025355458
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès				596.7194484005422
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own apartment				435.7082907102279

monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france in some parts of france yes excellency you know the environs of paris then no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude				11054.181383749696
will they not sign it no said the paralytic				17569.975066497776

you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist i deliver you up to buckingham				1764.7305720923364
we did not see his companion come out he may have gone by the other door what is he doing putting on his cloak and gloves he s ours muttered d artagnan				101.17390211799575
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor				2463.507510434739
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen s courtiers they are costumes of battle d artagnan and porthos obeyed				1628.3659990323404
if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it				59.52297437103955
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion				3831.190181047009
tréville was one of these latter				3845.422165475394
you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern				214249.72981343578
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort				41808.25610421564
de chevreuse and mme				156.80547544268114
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence				233223.53609794582
but not until two o clock said d artagnan with the same calmness				24822.194823866907
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered				150049.17279826466
water oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice				219.5878198738912
we have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord				906.661050913922
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence				2638.5429729178654
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence				155074.08491443703
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary				9446.138574209966
for ever and ever cried the youth oh				874.5306676893327
mouston cried porthos				111.81945556237285

don t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck no one asks for your secret all the world knows your discretion				43711.21371139871
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone				6701.3822104378805
when he came up again the light had disappeared				385.323577635192
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience				12040.811644279174
and why ah very well said d artagnan i see that you understand french				2179.1513856135443
no i make you my lieutenant general said the king				411.9832702392134
is it as hopeless as he thinks alas				1821.352633349005
you ll excuse me i know they exchanged bows and d artagnan returned to his companions				1012.7468789716082
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo				14127.083863852511
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio				4796.781151057915
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of cross examination which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin				290.8267080598038

the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive				131600.3788938691
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				10861.743551275642
do i for instance fare better				985.8809569660896
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced				10714.488694571446
then the diamond is safe said he timidly				3792.677679761075
i have touched the hand of the great man cried bonacieux				4277.704112821993
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity				2081.6375541978523
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you the devil said d artagnan whom the positive tone of m de tréville began to disquiet the devil				1302.930074452497
m d avrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat				2180.9081729745117
why what ails you asked he of edmond				3013.1008836539218
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this				1023.4435301340029
his excellency does not receive visitors today then here is my master s card the baron danglars				490.75441639733907
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller				33904.75854872748
i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me				62.5421303941475
the same evening some friends of mine visited me m				451.8869014728153
we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people				852.9769858090402
well porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea				2360.6834809787097

baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance				64718.70350127811

then i should become simply no				313.46921831530966
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread				22179.710583406053
fortunately you won t be laid up more than a fortnight				5738.192803634911
felton remained in the corridor				9871.732122092726
ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely				19348.457970690535
some voices even added long live the marshal but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet				35537.914076676585
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea				1048.8064646804728
well said d artagnan				5.098311209198359
bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the louvre that was all				431.6405137344503
the old father and mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other s arms				618.8896696961922
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf said he				21.675221228450997
d artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau				5679.199577184794
good morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m de boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest				9384.112120556914

the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank				3060.310988674978
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel				2336.164217953619
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked athos				55.480877832006264
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left m de villefort i intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house				410.0578691748707
if you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the other s shoulder				1433.3762197899457
the great are often ungrateful very true said d artagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queen s diamond which mazarin wore on his finger				1072.1116860318073
valentine had not seen him				25.9158728614506
now here montaran we will do better than that let each take a half of the handkerchief yes perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon				164689.31273557447
yes a thousand times yes and who completed it as it now is i did				2152.061419069543
what has happened then sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen				430.491294201673
has your excellency anything to ask me said vampa with a smile				311.86470207558864
now i think we are rich since instead of the francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of but we owe something in this house thirty francs but i pay that out of my francs that is understood and as i require only eighty francs for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury				20880.089386227646
i saw him yesterday your friend s lackey was leading him do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles yes				954.0011191043353

order i am ready for everything for everything cried d artagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus				1380.4844955428064
i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart				316.62680475711096
this letter				599.8000992172862
what matter if you are paid for it said athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table				640.0705272693476
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris write to him now s the time you are sure of your enterprise yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them				77.92503095547784
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife				47552.08145602864
athos smiled				296.6555317760866
and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to so much the better				1019.6557451373463
he could not see it but he felt its presence				2606.968762906529
i have placed reliance upon you my friend				185.20806943584446
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good				3525.373882265476
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down				737.4238034370896
yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures				5585.364044758252
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open				3475.7627193459375
ah you speak spanish enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place				457.316952741204
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled				109700.03766667546
there s a fellow who will never desert me so long as you are rich				1984.3225235656234
yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly				2717.717014388366
at bottom the character of m bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice				94845.70704426052
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry				9231.279795368751
monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis monsieur d arminges said de guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible				626.6921534366764
your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and i advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal why i am ready to tell everything cried bonacieux at least all that i know				680.8322225264765
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart				305.364928809402
yes said porthos but there are the equipments that is very true				647.3993471866013
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came				1450.5110073172784
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				194.4291232578531
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way				510.6470631410173
i am of a frankness of character quite french rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile				415.54091033679555
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty				184943.15794378179
yesterday for two hours i was at the church of saint philippe du roule and for two hours i prayed most fervently				26113.980392021895
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him				31.003590243478982
gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw				9440.59094340006
a terrible vision chapter xli				242798.74624983492
i congratulate you				38.060149339227635

the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected				384421.9731472218

monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step				2111.901508275349

it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefort s dressing room i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure valentine screamed				11197.387637063986

more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother				1123.7423571326174
cruel enough if i am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges				13216.767928419536
this time it was mordaunt who smiled				295.82719019237277
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm				10812.53821079949
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan				180.42632335402485
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away				546.028642136846
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it				58.26938507107459
i have it still the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hôtel d espagne				113753.4291424451
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want				2256.726582764944
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell				14989.734629277948
look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel				438.96627524040673
you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable what must i do to attain such sublimity you are today free as air come and dine with me we shall be a small party only yourself my mother and i				1222.065022261351
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder				1475.9317349077053
what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort				214.65721276361504
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason				3432.3183338939075
what is it i hear a horse it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us no said d artagnan it is in advance that is another thing said porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan				173.86529790888636
mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber				17474.458153917414
but by what means				2118.386668069436
what is it you want said the inspector				2160.8171292868124
d artagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m de tréville grasped the situation				4476.232697790027
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid				14986.918714794205
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety				2306.024697248352
no no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone the honorable the king s attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris				389.8483614937817
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m morrel to be admitted				3633.36711498964
what do you say to a thousand crowns d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner				1019.7948106075743
although i don t despise sweet things in proper time and place i found the supper rather light poor fellow said d artagnan				81.48339100011121
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor				877.1425327513022
suppose i happen to strangle him to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world but you will not do so i hope				1540.1731961459104
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten o clock i shall see what color his is then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp				350.920248944012
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him				29.877956049078293
d artagnan owned nothing				938.4093921740055
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this doubtless doubtless athos				153.9742107507033
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased				216043.1947953372
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break				85673.12718696264
why do you like that best because then i have no responsibility				13420.946199010225
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up				1085.2243376859788
my friend				189.33264186128523
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois				10979.187496927721
i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt				3175.616981745091
coquenard s chamber they were heartrending				158200.2231696427
the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him baptistin who rode in front attended the count				231.7329723877622
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself then replied d artagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes				380.71767364892213
from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts				64413.476686483424
i shall return very safely to the louvre all alone as you please madame bonacieux said the ex mercer				67556.39451343258
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified d artagnan and i no doubt with them for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice				9215.490789558029
and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant				1872.5628259807406
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor				1824.351384995689
has morrel whom we know been killed				1537.3768942643717
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain				9116.539180969336
argumentum omni denudatum ornamento				207153.5751013741
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy				35662.95629392253
on their way they met grimaud				383.74192078904304
i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin how well you reason said porthos admiringly				72257.96325715084
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk				20740.471681444862
april well said faria when the young man had finished reading it				49.667766868508906
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak				1772.602536721637
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met				5654.377800952632
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master				1066.488719521706
m de villefort followed them				66.34871240946534
see what they have done cried morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards valentine				937.3025609702578
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father s heart beat violently				8318.026177046107
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips				402.43066894892723
your betrothed valentine de villefort p s my poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness				4162.7014318192205
kitty will conduct you to my chamber the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words				653.0060905740287
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale				17549.09271159076
certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh				859.4132634732135
everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts				1989.7023194207818
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others				1156.1664518787852
doubtless it is said m danglars conceals at least half of his fortune and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said andrea with a look sparkling with joy				918.1256818206641
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris				392.7330920835168
pray was not monsieur d artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude to guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out i know nothing but what the public knows				3746.6903598738963
one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kind hearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence				7613.377106562434
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort s brow				1708.2836931446168
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned				197567.06022527872
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning				6409.7002089153075
the count has only been two or three days in paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the marais is and if he does not you will show him ah monsieur returned julie it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister				3435.49164102286
everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person this sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into				17322.323421981935
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears				246333.6168916641
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count				225.6977253750119
i am myself a frenchman				19777.90398011254
he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring				13160.332406052732
he cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds				2101.9603866742414
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it what do you mean sir inquired raoul				1683.045090127559
project gutenberg is a registered trademark				2738.0699268761205
be it understood we are speaking of athos				176.24481914276708
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water i left half because it seemed so bitter noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak				1301.0998115912594
it is well said he kissing it it is my master s ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it				61.44087748922235
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal				397.05604960790856
as a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of rochelle as at suze and perpignan but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage we want men of talent				30078.88623482106
the procureur exerted himself to reply				593.964386774612
you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis				178.85406026954155
he seemed to be quite overcome				7484.685230183125
these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercédès coloring				184383.6608707144
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your course you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend help cried caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally wounded i may not die perhaps they can yet save my life your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead				674.9225157224823
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him he will enter by this door				187.7132877054362
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated				3507.5430625284266
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay				4902.887393767189
you will take a biscuit with it will you not yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging monte cristo rang baptistin appeared				1064.6620790958161
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos well answered well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people that broussel shall be given up to them madame never said the queen never your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps				2122.725553900159
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend				163.7719611474792
finish mouston finish the work cried porthos				88.60008054741276
what could that mean				2865.633111841655
then d avrigny spoke				7815.165431837543
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of d artagnan				156.04555912005785
help cried d artagnan stop my horse has the staggers in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam				21473.09358536032
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin				462.3329511578799
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm but what then				835.9796884786905
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude				8390.895874728041
i am going home				1751.2386442839131
you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator				473148.87996986293
d artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense				105735.10197726324
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open				3652.258995975673
be civil or i shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one s rank you don t choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned d artagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name enough				1346.808466066247
compared with such things what is the letter you have just read a lover s deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her				137.56487591184984
for instance there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end				1027.48738978935
as for that benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him no far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast				50942.23235521103
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina				139151.5546279603
chapter l the interview				3142.435604618698
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together				842.6432314187114
d artagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door				193.1366888231711
it was time for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee				5601.489645230665
to the installation of my rival at m danglars what rival ma foi what rival				3857.7529535094277
this is the case said d artagnan this is your brother madeleine you don t know him perhaps but i know him he has arrived from amsterdam				180398.12372171276
there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice altisimâ voce				197073.27832108183
will you allow me father said carmela				690436.1993397691
tenacem propositi virum				151657.85735716918
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them				82.9628680721409
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you				58.14653830421951
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen				460.4850312469048
yes raoul replied the count				109.45909508296059
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected				68599.05319803531
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal				32095.604892054234
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time				326.99180584310716
i have lost even the knife that saved me				52.34754572074905
that will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and i accept thankfully then to yours monsieur what is your name boisrenard monsieur boisrenard to yours my gentlemen				1523.951611892574
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister				6635.175392525662
he is moving and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see				1376.3364214696446
i believe so i don t know it s of no consequence				42893.692425265515
we must understand each other said the duke				792.3766977379286
the devil but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is where is he at notre dame what has he to do at notre dame he is beadle bazin beadle at notre dame				2926.853558682458
d artagnan hits on a plan				2892.4222721037927
pardon for whom cried he				28.451965631295263
he will come in here and m morrel had better go do you not think so grandpapa yes signed the old man				121.75229375774462
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend				347.49555613802175
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfather s look at that moment would more than compensate for all dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels				17058.368948704156
milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was coming				2623.0304044766167
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse				933.5121438694171
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the gascon s blade terrified them				72.76022576240744
come four				4502.052422965454
you refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment				1298.0466259834363
fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god				478.8058377240568
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments				19659.450406766566
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan				49.63756782940668

as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dog s trick or other and that immediately said tréville				914.9021673882113

d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				6897.477586107433
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates				7732.813112793449
the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by d avrigny				1619.6394771491941
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years				1471.4533588178913
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune				4743.746214931909

he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life				463.1654861057323

the wretches were dancing				10298.531427186883
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa				7594.848646263271
my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose				108606.61482355188
yes what is it have you confidence in me give your orders said the three musketeers				2456.995417890176
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him				27.560434621973943
however promise me one thing what is it promise me i say i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is				4154.666257594158
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music paper				1007.8167624920724
it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him				29.89055298082194
that m danglars speculates whereas he never does truly madame i recollect m debray told me apropos what has become of him				25.213193298891564
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you				78.67271223350483
well did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward				3657.2606167486088
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone				922.7155918856641
well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph				7546.935788184619
and alexander vi				3894.6116288902
the spaniards that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation				32995.490094207154
where are you going asked dantès				182.47141187444544
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her				153.0377267604745
an enemy in my house do you say edmond				4475.387541691589
and what else does your worship wish for to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom the viscount de bragelonne				9107.336661134628
so beautiful				9990.240419588878
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert				713.5785149503316
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying				10516.81562691307
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms				613.083351802034
what s to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you can not take me with you no the order is imperative				62518.07433494107
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray				601.5894485241561
the closet was empty				3579.664666503413
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared				1143.2526177534542
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me				67.56440964482657
how happy i am at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up				1079.720502699237
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present				3525.770627494851
villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied				2319.6757712233334
a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed				12776.51791632076
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month				3790.717783554408
what is her brother in law s name lord de winter where is he now he returned to london at the first sound of war well there s just the man we want said athos				118.66701898245816
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the executioner				1792.5612081357342
troops five or six thousand men courage plenty then the thing is easy				3228.617121696515
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand				158.48599007719145
the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess				4105.229225804276
before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs go laporte said the queen				283.3941443794022
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please				43558.07714298748
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table				668.72569576798
does he correspond with aramis				124.10386446268168
the best				5985.395820096327
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir				672.0559824611234
the curates asked him what was to be done				898.6029966974992
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one				1168.302136528916
they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for francs				674.8565441793945
these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village				8497.96220092653
stop and let us talk talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos				29.204982904129206
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us pshaw said monte cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and joyful maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count				187.98299188126865
come parry said the king cease your tears if it s parry said the bishop i have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out when aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of england				766.7453156388787
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerf s i will await her return and beg her to come up here				646.031999361036
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his				681.4847490449604
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room				91.79803155538748
you also stand aside he said to the masked man				93.1059985187659
repeat it				39.79232669366539
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory				1406.76865208774
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s				762.0691881797712
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement				2404.5191584262548
signed abbé busoni it is the same what do you mean said the major				5562.3526478643835
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood				1480.3051509726404
and what does it concern then my captivity i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him				29.446639751439943
well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy				1524.4829051916354
when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell				15350.606959653374
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities				117520.59318247993
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem				210357.18230302894
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united				38511.08940126129
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke				1461.3250689654549
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion				1229.9560253555348
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance				727.2845460966863
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend				10818.78887066893
we will go on gentlemen said the queen				240.2948801759866
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting				12787.281482116137
and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man				112.29035057017681
as monte cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and sparta why demand permission ere you enter				1109.1007771865518
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st germain				4696.830739537544
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate				278379.69125795376
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out he did get out nevertheless do you think of escaping in the same way i am a prisoner then parbleu said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted				104771.28618571261
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence my chaise broke down coming into lilliers capital what capital yes i want your chaise and how shall i travel then on horseback you talk very comfortably a hundred and eighty leagues what s that one can do it				60.50110380914743
i was there at a fearful moment				370.21942803628514
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance				5664.675933165188
are you sure that no one is aware of the queen s project mazarin reflected				3683.6677272255024
i know it well so take grimaud take mousqueton take bazin take planchet				906.4362673501493

at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				18264.953114244177

the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss but yet detail them to me why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one				1211.254604226214

at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms				615.7917159868748
your history is a terrible one mr mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an all powerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information my lord to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwell s person				1113.3556674965303
milady knew the rest				916.4181143882399
d artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier				5928.574650653032
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way no nonsense caderousse i will offer myself as floor polisher the rooms are all carpeted well then i must be contented to imagine it that is the best plan believe me try at least to give me an idea of what it is how can i nothing is easier				20823.891562310288
then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let				83907.40101929738
seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal				403.0601890063178
in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs				1096.4083278401674
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				463.89753416065355
keep that ring for love of me				69.7479359972877
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair				316.7772159797586
i am accustomed to adversity				358446.79661115614
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur				113432.55376768984
i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded				150579.5707842605

the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study				858.79509743071
its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of francs i will not say granted but offered me three months				2146.455512991182
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was				548.52081467584
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saint méran coffins				128430.17859471012
ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening				700.8138335294639
he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès				434.91971770753224
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of d artagnan and athos				209.7639872391401
then while passing he had cast a rapid investigating glance into the kitchen and he was obliged to confess to himself to the shame of the procurator s wife and his own regret that he did not see that fire that animation that bustle which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living				3356.279834891463
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it				59.30612863339097
by the bye continued d artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and d artagnan went out followed by bernouin				44230.26381770251
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something about poetry who is this officer inquired raoul of athos who is speaking monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near monsieur scarron raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived				2365.4137412349546

baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him				30.666849461652145

your pardon m morrel said dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service				1506.4850678658804
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky				7086.127777332133
coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal				57309.98601799135
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed				26513.68308694185
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris				364.85443385393233
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land				2999.9288225518476
she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days				1700.8133331951765
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha s ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper				18592.152845918226
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room				93.65528645028697
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together				844.5306044693699
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by château renaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel				536.3823570824846
well resumed athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants				103106.92969712534
he can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it fifty thousand francs for being your father				1039.5425755173255
very well said he				23.607182257763025
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps				3804.4402139453455
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured				156995.44821904888
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor				9641.407690739006
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone in the morning when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast				6475.22552531388
yes but never with the same advantages said d artagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight very good very good said the voice				161.02746119038892
they found the door ajar				166565.47732600823
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine s absence had done				927.9547928216609
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed				6733.8884045912055
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her				127.6631045311901
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way				500.73849735507093
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba				2483.747919693342
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began				3898.5432261884266
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square headed nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another				574.052705937213
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud				831.7835528748163
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain				886.9553031443531
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred ah ma foi who is to know perhaps it is some political difference my father and the baron d épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort				278.7190264551747
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account				1855.8786156037488
oh not the least in the world madame				896.2254720498631
my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered				934.4162019076157
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it				58.80872778302165
now he said are you in pain yes my head is not only swimming but burning what s the matter with this head said d artagnan raising the battered hat				2871.911941722119
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville				874.732940306219
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything degenerates i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis				61.44061381414736
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting				13535.705420912158
speak to the governor then and where is the governor in the country anger mounted to d artagnan s face he frowned and his cheeks were colored				19064.589859026408
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments				10161.683381173465
what are these things replied anne with queen like dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful				10804.003543001392
do you think of dying my lord said she				106.35528556969784
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained him				26.13738589605181
au revoir albert				347.32989684393704
the man was m de villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman no excellency returned bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it go on that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden				2548.6715007007697
you are a brave fellow as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used				3954.1021978562057
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands				388.16816312851444
the angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church and what did the count do the count was of the highest nobility				14539.901069216548
the very madness of the abbé faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity				4272.232876653273
yes i did wait yes i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me				69.31027069569423
he perceived château renaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at arms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done				915.4764648642647
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms				619.1089749690967
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself				150.51968543757778
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear				5094.512145500068
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly				2096.8629026374965
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue				13249.46654952157
two hours thus glided away				530.1515143359125
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said d avrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation				14798.591591396547
besides this time my visit has a motive milady trembled she thought felton had told all				274.132928337083
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed				2412.8541869512005
listen then ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them listen continued the abbé				647.4277485835414
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp				26148.345920890693
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them				78.28928047027688
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity				1694.3909283142832
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies				82831.601962977
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbé busoni who looked cold and calm as usual				2298.2022576464115
he left the saucepan				156734.2502100852
she is amiable and well behaved what is her name she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty				5297.732307874769
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken				1649.7823155722026
come then said d artagnan you are right				1149.0742781765541
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained				377173.5771380731
is the king of the spaniards never had a penny in his pocket go on sir i see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what i think that stops you i can obviate the difficulty ah i knew well said the gascon that you were a man of talent				28209.164634323595
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival				26741.797719685947
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court				1511.0794301233407
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot				48867.38420515855
arrived in london you will seek buckingham i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity				245064.0919059175
then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation				24821.934430046247
meanwhile let us sit down and eat caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor				6091.021003686474
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember what do you mean my lord i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience i have but you in the world haydée through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice do you hear him valentine exclaimed haydée he says that through me he will suffer through me who would yield my life for his the count withdrew for a moment				368.4554753593014
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself				2040.8183283816174
i obeyed my love and have i not been richly paid for that obedience				78553.17830394903
marseilles resounded with their well earned praises				382277.7879020259
unquestionably edmond s star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain too and laugh at us all unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair he added				8374.61923953501
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client				16075.13632847955
coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey				97864.27243252001
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again				250.26230176522998
as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed infamous task				3678.615959607965
morrel guessed all this				1087.93307340504
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples				130686.8836300562
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty				2032.8716252048216
the king called the cardinal				374.0544156660197
fie pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher higher				20874.57426774082
so now i breathe again i am happy don t be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed d artagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering				69669.4305436797
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions				7098.180519003035
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no				298.13018979926807
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions				4106.975710249019
i know something of him but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back tomorrow which means that you now hesitate no i do not hesitate god forbid				43254.27786064675
i will give you three replied the stranger				3689.183780357102
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor				133341.7451129698
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis				18.94133189207306
see what she writes to me athos said he				17.49220531430842
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them				72.61385712899354
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan				167.33136093300178
what did he say to me				41.74084398980894
in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil				89208.63680402565
d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them				76.81703093444273
now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you oh cried eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me				72.27752957445286
and now i am a frondeur not of broussel s party nor of blancmesnil s nor am i with viole but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and d elbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers				275248.7957113184
what are these things he asked				825.9109267544677
women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself that s what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever				2528.444507225567
i retained my harness by instinct				161779.86818732298
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself				200.20487190647992
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress				40333.72616339562
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations certainly and that is why m and madame de saint méran have died that is why m noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward				4323.961441305957
he would not however yield immediately to the young man s request but made a few conscientious objections				65324.34451679127
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room				93.4130608923365

you never come to me without conferring pleasure				946.569801713651
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly				7059609.680976615
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs				32661.502497944315
has he gone intending not to return undoubtedly at ten o clock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton there a post chaise was waiting for him he entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau then what did you mean stay he left a letter for me a letter yes read it and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray				600.8091215740061
now sir said the count you are safe calm yourself ah				215.2507786081691
louis xiii				1318.3049458051487
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of d avrigny				1595.8764090890709
to dinner said d artagnan				5.031468089389314
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard				203545.57412510444
to lift their hands against a minister of god come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other the wounded man smiled sadly				18270.82419886205
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady				858054.7038598527
and what grimaud dictated				89148.67839258151
up sire				4057.7617305183867
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another				564.0259008577158
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everything you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni				3609.1822278063914
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name				521.3835435860093
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abbé edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abbé edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la réserve				58166.75996496912
i do assure you grandpapa ah m				448.55141455386035
five millions a pretty sum eh peppino hush here is our man the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads one was writing and the other praying when the door opened				2673.9131937573206
three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman				1304.3106804303563
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger				12145.414315764594
oh yes was the ready answer				1010.4797183110785
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed				150109.14285889303
no a more material interest stirred his blood				1465.6153676459103
how you manoeuvre my instructions count				128.61187211137963
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice				193.25737063389104
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing				30442.73559573693
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before				1231.110189882112
barrois said she				140.8558095893204
we are on the very eve of it				59.50370559247958
in july we added francs it was you know the month of the spanish bonds				15832.677444519537
who him him m				526.5583703264672
my dear fellow don t speak like that of monsieur groslow				2480.9000236797087
a police agent entered				820.623886366206
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless				4746.126430055367
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni				159240.7205836246
three months since it was m de saint méran madame de saint méran two months since the other day it was barrois today the old noirtier or young valentine you knew it cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing and what is it to me replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders do i know those people				858.2809126209869
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you i do not enter the church i re enter it				48.882225007375204
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				4991.056021368011
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head				471.6600924619373
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart				309.2355248247629
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there won t be any parliament at all and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it				53.413974413194104
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point				1384.1994741125118
in an instant all five were ready				1730.913678563594
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady				749.0086799771351
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons				258617.44481375103
this time i have merely come from cadiz you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit				1769.2441916380908
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he i have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine no upon my honor cried his majesty s guardsman				20980.351356639203
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring the goldsmith knew the duke				1150.4832991330884
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury				20523.56297470753
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight				4895.841418796105
i m your man i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner				3018.6547571217106
he will not go today said d artagnan but here i ll pay you for us two in that case let us go said the shipmaster				353399.48633638653
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through				5347.675947318571
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio				141125.21169636742
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs				1076.0332729454865
oh yes returned monte cristo i make no secret of it				61.553775667719115
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience				1524.0584371196012
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond				2985.065909187903
what must i do above all things be always on your guard				2400.089480381462
a pleasure boat with striped awning was going by				14019.445473858093
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity				1776.7685546971807
can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers				1087.7722675467935
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together impossible said d artagnan we are under mazarin s orders i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like d artagnan and porthos				127.79234562076601
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you				55.450039474498716
in fact the count s face brightened				8521.025829301034
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church				4441.428028206212
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance				78478.82376674679
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter				332.1858429006941
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter				4066.691391747463
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rochefort s servant				2472.6730191303654
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe				128738.46414490083
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way				519.6748835134348
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii				21187.089903524276
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous				229284.54781435357
no violence violence is the proof of weakness				3105.5911360109503
monsieur d artagnan murmured raoul				323.0873209904405
at the extremity of the wood d artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle				1932.9774373532575
the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once				754.0173098949488
monsieur le prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by madame de guemenee therefore madame i ask you to look not among your friends of to day but among those of other times among my friends of other times said the queen				302.2053572534172
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart				320.8382063309174
monsieur said emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to m delaunay				154009.3980203085
no said she withdrawing it gently no my friend touch me not				242.93572395741757
on the day after the morrow by eleven o clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was				562.3000147526536
thomson french said he do you know this house monsieur they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly				2143.537425040343
he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all				400.24290630952845
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence				27852.347882684466
i will send word to the governor very well returned dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad				2055.2599507828686
well over that coach house are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments ah diable bells did you say what do you mean oh nothing				1032.7156120826749
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes				17222.46897734275
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances well said andrea let it be as you wish				2313.7259192841034
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me				48.420710989148816
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice				159.99626797525403
on her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously				11069.055727443663
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter				625.3610855671435
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero				19718.428404002294
you have been to yanina said he				18.936265656507388
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing				7612.295341773337
make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield				171863.9781404778
you are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited i require my lord that normandy should be given to madame de longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution				24425.013682849545
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor drank				179862.32492846297
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden				2542.099133112161
now this point was settled mme				121.27363636602284
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath				29922.24263710086
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit				13957.572420572018
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet				867.4892028756644
at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables				19318.275404200933
i will extinguish the fire with blood				1474.74282734632
the thin spare man yes the executioner in short asked aramis				22.588936496296643
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants				927.3390604024395
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued d artagnan with his frank expression				2965.0492845768
he told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber				409.42991440075326
d artagnan entered behind him				25.516542157179735
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner				879.1000519686727
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo				326.30506857790533
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties				108938.66605460488
you yourself gave me this comb i was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders the duke looked furiously at grimaud				682.6542977496682
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house				410.38316590344334
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good shall i take any arms for what purpose any money it is useless				4281.993855201771
at last d avrigny slowly uttered these words she is still alive still cried villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is that yes said the physician i repeat it she is still alive and i am astonished at it but is she safe asked the father				971.9871225815191
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away				524.4820045654708
there is a way of detecting its presence				2343.491124043246
whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantès instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty				1979.332878211723
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene				1561.9422830243795
oh do not kill me cried the bandit				6699.688826359926
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name				513.8683998395264
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages				131412.25762869307
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases				126287.81374939372
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected				3714.90369015094
first my stranger of meung then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wounds next milady whose secret i have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance i have balked well said athos that only makes four and we are four one for one				1156.7929018837503
the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax a piece of luxury unheard of at that period and twenty violins were ordered and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate upon condition said the report that they should be played all night				527.3996662260813
but you said that your name was d artagnan who i yes you somebody said to me you are monsieur d artagnan i answered you think so my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it				51.88184321920158
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message				18882.307362444073
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied you mean george villiers asked felton whose looks became excited				7510.533457620179
chapter lxxviii				140698.81106261988
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for you would be all the wiser said athos				40.27717960345964
sir said the cardinal you have heard me				28.92108332889577
pyramus and thisbe about two thirds of the way along the faubourg saint honoré and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the wide spreading chestnut trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of louis xiii				1368.7177335137856
he pushed the door open and entered				860.5389014858008
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars				465.8544352975545
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand				159.67974012515637
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my son in law i would give five and we would share the profits very good father in law said cavalcanti yielding to his low born nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it				59.39368956624062
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercédès				3209.662927539118
do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of heaven is a brother				1657.3019441518418
yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal				392.239946216216
the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction and that will not be long it is to be hoped said porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes				343252.47783739155
about half past six we will be with you at that time said the major				5303.272535884457
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw d artagnan who stood expecting her				131.3624379819932
the air i breathe is the air of liberty				2030.4739022421634
he immediately called d artagnan				21.733607735705046
nobody knew				4398.496507962415
an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income that s true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses				121990.74247125804
the king s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioner s knife				2854.9973960466536
yes sir replied the englishman				1587.663883350772

the prince de marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to madame de longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately well that will do charmingly said the count but may i beg that the greatest haste may be made for i have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to morrow night in paris do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me oh sir cried raoul				1782.3053346716051

i did not lose sight of him for an instant				2021.284222869518
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly				16205.711957951979
let me overtake him he				89.57533420590178

and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell				1283.4935865035677
speak morcerf did not reply				580.0417315381018
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair				1665.183745422609
she lives she is in safety in a convent she is at béthune				4354.264629258196

as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it				61.44029154614796
don t you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage				2510.982078929766

villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim				27647.514383013437
do you preach them no i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators ah indeed				944.5899548886455
in italy asked the king eagerly				3650.315962408903

i promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you				79.57055676374436
hear the end				1009.9989621033741
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol				9982.70705972419
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him				31.23510508976309
in the bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort i am of monsieur de bassompierre s party				2326.5615358117484
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession				1776.8685305634865
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you				36.686178058729496
they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the feet and then threw them into the sea				1040.5691656153624
you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements				10853.967053450486
murmured he growing still paler				36146.196072847
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake				137019.55776448143
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet				68508.04736919634
i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you thank you my adored valentine thank you that is enough				1337.6867432545353
d artagnan comprehended their irresolution				124357.88839814217
singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket book				14667.668888436969
d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing				994.8582735709751
saved replied the young officer				2711.6977157987076
eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn				844.1734819283464
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends				298.11170963023386
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting				6411.797230772855
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them				79.21500040436362
who comes there he cried				1776.6855281688086
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				8601.0613240407
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips				411.0856920138507
love pardon for what asked she				107.35240671034066
read that he said				268.27802499852726
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false is it not inquired madame de villefort				225.07213179525436
and now said d artagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos				109.0804044842132
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently but we can not swim to the shore the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca				198047.91333989525
dear grandpapa cried she what has happened				3050.5727550211714
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing				314301.12554438045
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls				26133.5624570112
is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them beauchamp was thunderstruck				16837.57146122514
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				3456.985865938405
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt				3255.0257803883965
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her				146.56418776969159
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing				148742.82667412536
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen				138042.2049939527
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found monsieur mouston said d artagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to then taking porthos aside my dear du vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for i am going to take you to the cardinal s gracious me				69.89302683883025
midnight struck				3134.9344402563106
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity				4120.259150377113
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall				18178.638445205084
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey monsieur d arminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse				935.577172147351
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten				5023.235892412449
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned				18506.868580762886
you don t do your work by halves				136564.79141333717
now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet				16026.291239370554
d artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athos s and according to custom related everything to him				30.201346368543934
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks				114905.0243374437
you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugénie i am not aware of it said albert smiling sorrowfully				2691.7500427137193
i am an officer of fortune nothing else i have nothing but what my sword brings me in that is to say more blows than banknotes				61431.362499499206
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all				303.79566590765876
i must reach compiègne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family				1208.4099462325637
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count it appears so sir replied monte cristo				141.86744166131456
what were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that monsieur de beaufort had escaped were you not oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier				5065.5506344638325
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majesty s pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur d artagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said d artagnan bowing				3409.47494508576
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them				81.00081753037611
this was m morrel s wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened				8803.417513917015
thanks m bertuccio said the count springing lightly up the three steps of the portico and the notary he is in the small salon excellency returned bertuccio				2064.8522031545795
i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party				2358.8133725268676
fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat				2187.184894642445
who has given them to us said porthos				11.27370959648297

you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss				156252.49189898788
you do not understand the points of english horses the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity				260557.57872846324
at last his patience was exhausted				7089.088337447946
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty				3697.9476536409843
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar				4245.410628302587
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos				12.260765898322049
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron				5719.1259903195005
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy				142716.59706943802
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme				200.9610436030912
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other				759.167300671415
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him				27.81899659584725
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles				4577.993649259687
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone				919.3453164747092
they have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed i think i know him who is he remember that i affirm nothing monsieur the commissary and that i only suspect whom do you suspect				139864.14237745252
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise				237539.21329454647
once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything				378.70049560803386
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me parbleu what do you desire it to be what do you want would you like to know certainly well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one you jest i presume i never jest let me pass you shall not pass my brave young man i will blow out your brains				375601.73194627167
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you				62.13427277925576
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself				191.3363910620084
ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband mercédès and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope fernand replied mercédès you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry				482075.70146557695
the nails too were turning blue				48321.558564967425
colonel harrison is one of our friends				260.59246850331704
yes and her husband found out that she had a fleur de lis on her shoulder cried porthos				42.03125769487972
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being king s attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him well well returned m morrel we shall see				1252.792167908283
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second				2120.244092528727
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand				160.65096995431048
the abbé busoni repeated caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count				261.02599968308044
well you stand well with m morrel i hear you insinuating dog you m				604.4657654130589
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department				12633.76204136111
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him				30.78589989056539
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh				6244.367871647672
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains				3843.383698087251
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already due				9401.409308184404
the juncture was favorable				109134.67862022246
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame				32496.801306597565
planchet turned and returned the billet				40822.323989849254
he will answer you the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor				871.8218129837933
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least what is that did you observe d artagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton no but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles forget them for a time we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground do you think that likely no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it you reconcile me d artagnan well then assume a cheerful manner as i do we must joke with the guards we must gain the good will of the soldiers since we can t corrupt them				75.86790965493493
at last louis xiii				1292.9249853846045
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat				2115.6852961519744
he still lives are you quite sure of it i am he there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature				3552.5256683863686
aramis started back and drew his				848.1356279946601
it was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised				42194.348961832555
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb				3268.317237632639
excellency the evil has arrived m				518.0918731833445
save me i will not harm you andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies				13850.684006622718
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion				3757.5074939681126
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos				13.308097803655558
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly				122869.22839702581
the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès				150753.57552956554
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback				4550.145570751099
they brought me that book				17012.96007598517

do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abbé				461.3065396496745
this evening s adventure will serve for my excuse				4680.93844380897
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity				2054.0519359583836
the carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen				2521.2160989910894
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet				979.2368915801488
do you say that m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m le baron franz d épinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders				1106.7260952420818

when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it				59.459289155063956

i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne				10152.577982803039
she became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a console which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syllable				6460.21238285623
but the king is asleep i have something important to reveal to him can it not be put off till to morrow he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late come then said lord winter				803.4847198670498
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royale egad				7260.440976635557
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter				615.6681091656601

i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea				1048.9209960992828
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men				872.7418641999576
the feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles				1873.664998117418
happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one s self and the walls walls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness danglars is happy and fernand fernand				3374.6223349477877
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea				1040.9910058352204

i will join you again at marseilles well be it so let us part said mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere				205975.93917075935
the richest turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easy chairs and sofas offered their high piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment				27812.374119731034
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price				22853.193843528315
vampa took cucumetto s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained outside				16608.06563207837
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together				852.9192319450312

at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count you asked milady				500.6284361495678
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to d artagnan and porthos we ll search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy and i feel no doubt that thanks to d artagnan s ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master that poor planchet				992.3916860329961
although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him i will obey your orders my lord good bye until saturday when i may expect you may i not yes i promised you the count watched albert waving his hand to him				26.334101259132225
have you seen him i left him five days ago said d artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston				7543.021462203436
all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise				2849.150865897458
this night i have had a fearful sleep				958.9290319498299
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell				2481.0443520864414
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of				7341.8295323783495
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii				1286.1905167378125
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not				381.88239901621967
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place what was the cause of your quarrel when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends why do you not seek revenge i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre and what was the result of those duels the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one				1213.861095640613
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to d artagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said sir				861.7818881947362
and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels do you know this ring said d artagnan				49.74276967784515
well sir exclaimed mazarin what s the matter				933.4823204162061
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly do not let that disturb you i have enough for two no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse good caderousse so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me true remorse and besides an idea had struck me andrea shuddered he always did so at caderousse s ideas				5526.877208170948
that i believe answered m morrel but still he is charged with what inquired the elder dantès				424.1396042740316
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means and i have none either said the queen				249.53922743316275
i have a sure method of limbering tongues				199127.42204357887
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost francs upon the spanish loan and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss why not is it my fault you have lost francs certainly it is not mine once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to me				63.94012275304734
valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtier s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind				657.1223434001448
it was a very near thing but he is not dead as he said this d artagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him				32.0647859517269
d art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand				160.9905323806916
has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance to whom did he give up his sword he did not give it up he broke it he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage there was a momentary pause				11382.271345385027
there only then remained porthos and bicarat				18846.398437369793
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers				7383.192713439879
let me see it said milady				137.5767493082784
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve				13523.602516996181
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood				3533.5228296702808
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				2489.6980701998687
i am on the point of starting on a journey replied morrel disdainfully				127759.27383609168
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart				314.46194752417364
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera				2171.823529135405
the guards looked on it with indifference				6173.40829893942
no no be easy on that score				36039.76657475783
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid				11463.024420114216
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so				244.26363181604756
don t let it out at the hotel rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abbé				462.12025857964625
athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a foot				1680.9245155437281
he had the resolution to stop with this				1024.20804844814
m morrel unhappy exclaimed the abbé				457.3775790285355
at midnight my lord at midnight my dear monsieur louvieres when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house				408.3793577566467
go to the devil				1223.4661154298237
marie michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the door put her head in and asked for hospitality				26203.51482110003
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus				134024.32550394363
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more				1637.211360180361
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just				9489.532986349614
but i will tell you				39.62899860022979
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further				8420.026252432936
what would you have said the musketeer				1029.9262821503614

it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to england and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming				113937.34909409561
i shall ask him just the very way not to know				744.8884830234737
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel				4663.138331293703
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other good the other three exclaimed				1911.2812689574378
this league was directed against france				684.8759638484165
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head				464.89756588247286
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished				11915.96554456729
you come from the queen said mazarin looking fixedly at d artagnan				10.626162903410805
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law madame de saint méran heard her				126.22693518524189
if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death				439.42931570473314
call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone				889.503746645362
all my researches have been useless				4353.239070117132
pardon me d artagnan he said				239.529665336062
take some more of these cigars m de morcerf with all my heart returned albert italian cigars are horrible				106591.73402495253
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile				393.2759873865568
besides kitty will tell nothing will you kitty				3831.1609514970955
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected				3980.1048958576953
for god s sake tell me did you know this englishman but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service yes then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation everything is possible in this affair even a miracle what was his name asked monte cristo				316.0771134381663
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count may at half past ten and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual				10686.507176189138
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough				1348.8560967685935
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second				2140.0119750037525
so now i have told my secret a telegraph repeated madame de villefort				262.6291822809314
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it				46.42833481201823
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did				2225.476832934315
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily				20741.97498971514
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it				58.75589201017587
i only wish he would let me take his place shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of mercédès two o clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour to be sure to be sure cried dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers				224517.44276388834
lack a day				297.47115680559637
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristo s in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m de villefort indeed said m danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence what you count said madame danglars signing if you are take care for i shall never forgive you andrea pricked up his ears				3004.151700679646
porthos and aramis did the same				1014.5178273803604
in their stead d artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall				462.37285569291987
a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance				9968.341826011361
he entertains a very high opinion of m and madame de villefort which they deserve do they not i believe they do				932.2208159357605
yes just so				238.62267922090874
my grandfather intends leaving this house said she and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another but you mademoiselle de villefort you who are necessary to m noirtier s happiness i interrupted valentine i shall not leave my grandfather that is an understood thing between us				252.6435395982852
the guests in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the of may to do honor to the occasion				4243.500053497253
what a misfortune he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to milady s chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton				1129.4781319350589
tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there are you sure of it he has invited me to dine there there s a life for you said caderousse a town house and a country house that is what it is to be rich and shall you dine there probably when you dine there do you sleep there if i like i am at home there caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart				319.690409717878
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon				1812.0419968268718
and i know i shall drown before reaching it continued blaisois				7977.8528758602215
whatever may ensue i will go if you are determined said athos do so but the bastille said aramis				36.96789098193141
a slight color mounted to his cheeks				2770.505274789375
with whom with a child seven years old dear friend at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real				20527.360448196014
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you				69.26094503490575
let me conduct your business and my own				812.5145327509114
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale				860.0437673171954
what is the matter if you please sir replied mordaunt i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging wherefore sir				774.0851651455705
planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of d artagnan and which d artagnan from that time made shift to do without				25258.71821625972
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if i fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen				447.2562833246825
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m de château renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him				31.6513957626428
what comments must be made and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph it is frightful murmured mazarin				434.9054083170612
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse				862.9818154473268
if he troubles me too much i will crush him the insect				128413.52231835284
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest				16737.111168046787
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols				6356.290561216673
i am giving them the slip said eugénie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our direction and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step				2074.3942638141675
what would the patron think				2267.481834924249
ma foi yes though he was in his own element what do you mean the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists great is truth muttered the count fire can not burn nor water drown it				58.43650101516322
it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athos s eyes				386.93131039371434
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes				377.124265177818
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same things indeed he heard nothing else				1963.0083126917261
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time				323.7166521455963
the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed				1929.605980658137
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions well what next said d artagnan laughing in spite of himself				156.5980493577308
but first interposed d artagnan you must present me to madame du vallon a third sigh from porthos				170.41498022923386

a being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived				2356.897543116753
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme and you will probably find your theme ill chosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present				3669.8104049246003
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep				844.7472867843643
stop let me show you the way it is not worthwhile yes it is why because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichet s locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist thank you said andrea i will let you know a week beforehand they parted				134228.09042722537
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back				1073.1955143787536
but you general were you not at whitehall no said cromwell				1929.4431284442999
it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence				102425.79299682114
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed				4484.162733179917
did i advise your father to sell the castle of yanina to betray silence said albert with a thundering voice				166.9007318631872

selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token				94291.05589942423
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets				95891.72047692591
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people				840.6967355993197
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora				381782.296126222
how will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv support a double weight the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing				1954.2162246907362
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away				564.3907129636175
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die				1000.3954721089442
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale				868.7944256848913
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly well asked d artagnan				91.99004411684666

monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you our young friend will be extremely well received madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos				192.54046864053933

dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my father s commands it is more on your account than my own but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future because i judge it from the past still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance				5204.4637895150345

it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us				253.37379682594914
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled several persons hurried up to m de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy				3085.04875050528
now let us everyone retire to his own home said d artagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention				949.6091618206538
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours chapter vii				16711.273092540516
he rose however as they approached				3523.6193244757073

the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire				97635.13438153238
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers				41078.395685645715
i had only to cry out help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free why didn t you do it asked the lieutenant				1660.615664912942
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo				29738.636442618168
throw myself in the water and strangle him oh gentlemen cried athos be men				871.5765744312729

franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m de saint méran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness				1442.357923256955

between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged				22634.62256298696
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous				11525.330580980031
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither immediately				1665.6363991813105
look here				477.5203410722588
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute				19394.01446492296
it is not god s will that they should be accomplished				13257.024838773179

it was mordaunt with the order in his hand				153.57444137132498
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him				31.287665714343998
before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die				998.9773266719725

monseigneur your eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary i think i have not proved myself worthy of your goodness				6118.273015171349
oh cried porthos do you think so you are exaggerating athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant				1488.5151564859934

it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury				103750.33828536222
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home				2132.8238691166366
the reader may ask how came planchet here when he was left stiff as a rush in london				2258.454370039193

milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window				529.0454235752852
oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day				291.88117335184694
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others				1153.9495848625543
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward				23771.993611224127
i could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks				80898.22719983815

he shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream				1469.260954082152
you are then in possession of francs asked the notary				2314.4254985174016

no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes				88101.57837980193
you are only betrayed the king sighed deeply				58422.54807457022
the usher returned and made a sign to d artagnan to follow him				26.598255796825814
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated				114732.0152022813
long live the coadjutor cried the crowd				10496.53526144942
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same				1022.5459746760887
go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do				921.8584593156273
this time there could be no doubt d artagnan was really insulted				170802.39733039917
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms				93765.39821559601
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm				16150.12325500047
madame de lannoy whom according to your majesty s command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day that s it cried the king to him no doubt				3273.554721931977
we must leave you said monte cristo				81.68630731415604
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse				1412.9104452177826
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling				640.8376726678524
i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept				6824.984157240956
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan				150.96433102683704
this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in				576.0560624329102
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her				157.87661833103522
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop				1075.703917880684
you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to justice it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse it was la carconte yes said monte cristo and god i can not say in justice for his justice would have slain you but god in his mercy spared your life pardieu to transport me for life how merciful you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch				5518.155584510347
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome				861.1394338512295
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace				5153.615985116619
you have seen your dream realized i can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor benedetto is rich he has an annuity well you have an annuity i have yes since i bring you your two hundred francs caderousse shrugged his shoulders				1153.1250607587824

well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself stay said the young man				84.30840983177613
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse				938.8502521392477
paternal affection				10863.7118571096
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul				1885.2815404383548
oh yes i can see it all before me this moment was it not his betrothal feast it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested yes and up to this point i know all said the priest				1984.8486797946764
every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy				3094.1179364323975
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage you speak charmingly said porthos				168.33235401808432
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends				308.2562082172093
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it but at the first words she read she became livid				14258.33397597482
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference				9197.00939199321
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting				11915.954180622415
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous				69587.55577049164
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses				1004.6481063786027
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people				844.7835401828789
yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor				613.694648887136
morrel was mad				1840.9145568037382
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations				4528.522026584419
sometimes we don t go to bed at all well what of that why he would be annoyed if i did not play with him does he play well i have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down bring him with you then but how about our prisoners let your servants guard them yes and give them a chance of escaping said d artagnan				162.87130639862792
the anjou wine after the most disheartening news of the king s health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward				1910.291777438549
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers				2629.5436719387253
mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion				1237.9021134284346
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts d artagnan				6.16538836590824
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side				1115.4567841115984
to give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven				174235.7986490425
that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with concini and if i gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then				925.4131159360344
i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by				11054.539820582544
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him				30.452794082485767
for all evils there are two remedies time and silence				505.9370711793004
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm				1641.0716985209117
that emetic villefort see if it is coming villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic				150680.12705326464

well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and i should become rich				2002.4908354063905
the other day a banker s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold caderousse was filled with wonder the young man s words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis				3141.9471543834957
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table				658.4666934160658
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question what is it sir you are fond of gardening passionately and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it you live badly on your thousand francs badly enough but yet i do live yes but you have a wretchedly small garden true the garden is not large and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything ah they are my scourges tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him then what would happen i could not repeat the signals and then not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined how much a hundred francs the tenth of your income that would be fine work ah said the man				119.610111803678

the château d if cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled				303.8068204142089
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress				1143.3098594460105
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net				71631.13103445084
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried felton				2374.929894521852
at all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me				67.92734141668554
our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at table at least i hope so two benefactors of humanity what shall we do said debray we have only one monthyon prize well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma and where does he come from asked debray				612.1783482409087
the queen				414.4175603457472
at three o clock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin				9085.570960106066
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger				13061.205892887812
the president s sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general s and had no guard				2438.5759976589597
yes replied m de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in or and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers				2981.1712093973524
if he lays his hand on the boat s edge i will cut it off regicide that he is and i said porthos				60.216773035782694
albert listened with the most profound attention				999.2827133763457
p s do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house				408.09923675173167
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body				1259.0515463792044
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat				68883.0438660419
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved be satisfied i will deny it it was the only letter you had it was swear it i swear it villefort rang				12463.969303540582
the result of these reflections was that d artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight				4307.584526236199
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice				4526.678302101445
you the comte de la fere on the side of broussel blancmesnil and viole				106017.62025216414
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son				616.9414778677451
as happy as it is allowed to one of god s creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think d artagnan for you have not yet done so you are too bad athos one can hide nothing from you answered d artagnan				149.43637943126802
persons whom i do not like yes indeed				859.1006428105171
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her				127.59025853164135
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought d artagnan				128.2714683708066
danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side				1117.8123546677734
athos sighed deeply				50957.97545207138
they reached saint german without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bare headed to offer her his hand				161.4460926282049
what are you about said d artagnan				4.504530554323231
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty it s true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and stupid porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew d artagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose				2050.5436133711473
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses				3555.0404187795743
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth				1202.2446716825923
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis				202.52725338895027
that will do said he leave the rest to me will the petition go soon today countersigned by you the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom				21086.121488642846
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence				13244.009061794308
oh do not say so it will break my resolutions but not mine mother replied albert				310.5900552122793
it appeared likewise that mme				107.63606414368867
from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow				83447.90669538087
i came to pray over the body of your daughter and now why are you here i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni no the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face				323.9878220441599
and what is the news you should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news i know it but in asking for news i mean have you done anything for me had you commissioned me said monte cristo feigning uneasiness				2266.1966291906074
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met				5304.683792578383
well at twenty nine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife				891.7061024044768
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced				10862.271850981764
bravo cried d artagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis				22.040211193324634
the office of the king s attorney chapter				207.24079502125826
i knight you monsieur le comte then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king				504.49380734425114
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced				1381.156749069269
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returning that will reduce the sum to five thousand livres				993.2324615884678
oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies				1265.7121139233395
barrois said valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you know will you open it barrois looked at the old man				111.9379946591765

the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier				37363.30268846678

he again cried porthos who was breathing like a blacksmith s bellows why he is made of iron oh my god muttered athos				103.30017246876403
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m de tréville s tone of voice that he was very angry about something				5036.710534505097
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed				93707.64961889411
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well				527.4914657862021
the great man has called me his friend yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified				177929.52063526196

a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged				168516.3626396917

the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands				399.09658412142056

a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale				902.6974946897354
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped				2553.975726120672
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty				7001.808820651845
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens albert approached				3725.4975923649945

he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become				160789.929118605
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around and porthos heaved another sigh				1868.3378963649059
act prudently oh do not fear besides you will accompany me				44.20569581281725
blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies				45326.93830584556
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four o clock though he never spent the night there				532.8282799819639
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				445.53320318555046
yes yes war said anne of austria				2837.1635807942575
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion				4337.706752829687
it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duke of buckingham it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off it was you who in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to monsieur d artagnan it was you who believing that de wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends				320.157522740952
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided				100820.80823824968
bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messenger s words				646.1521508372106
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for				637.6061395148715
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m de tréville				900.7900821826657
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes				99925.2282056448
he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for pontoise				107676.06397695275
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise				1668.0216115987166
the orders came				1457.8868584177394
they advanced to the plain				7793.321102923664

adieu perhaps farewell at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw				101108.9005075001
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us amen responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea				2321.707474002615
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched				6512.7745561428455
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan				160.8267964854056
had any one but you been there i don t say d artagnan bowed				1329.0291583837416
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages				26248.9352892358

but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself				193.4369667039356
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death grimaud hesitated				1423.4604717793172

what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another				568.5027406556313
near the barrels stood selim my father s favorite whom i mentioned to you just now				1697.015560020367
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m d épinay into personal contact				61873.50911564299
well what is it asked louis xviii				2515.384923273657
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m				740.617884984141
the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water				1305.086474973841
at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinal s treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orange tree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from not even the cardinal it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos				171.39845523636473
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves				154487.4816576968
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end				1051.4874738871122
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and i were drinking and what did you do said d artagnan				92.80578674891422
i don t very well know				706.5643736633183
pardieu if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people				849.1007245314141
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based				81616.89490628446
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal				3199.425030430484
for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother country as they have preserved its language				3605.979162500159
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven and very soon they left the inn				19645.9747027897
the world is a sepulcher alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh				1949.903761755111
bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great				23018.292263714062
and that one if i mistake not a lamprey just so				298.8436880637603

but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan				151.4592483231341
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honor i think perhaps too often that i am in haste great haste				1679.0603959932757
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars				14244.674726881989
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies				1262.4927157355537
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again				253.07712072376756
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan				183.8152328278413
but surely you are monsieur d artagnan and thou planchet cried the lieutenant				1664.0098016521902
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed				1609.4010998820625
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan				168.20269231307648
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you				69.1972008092284

oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation				5272.339813241097
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced				1337.978914462527
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do				922.8255947123794

the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her				151.470009693656
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil the terror of all expert palates				169111.07129747682
it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions				16422.686664487814
very well come this way d artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through				5424.895573712732
what do i see that he wouldn t swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldn t swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers				114253.65942205
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation				7991.8948753261275
that s the whole story				4261.278877598842

so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another man s fortune				1047.008611974486
suddenly about nine o clock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying				21881.644961230762
they are mistaken bring him here at eight o clock sir and may heaven bless you as i bless you and now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us better my lord diable				162047.7747731848

he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought				1394.5916426931294
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends				309.4207837617303
he was occupied with the preparations for raoul s departure and was seeking to gain time				331.755910890222

yes sir you have not been long detained no				257.51717728485056
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this				1011.0966544408374
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism				153016.7993123857
now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell				19260.25548257442

whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery				16016.970794648612
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps				4077.4562595977695
the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open				3630.6480695158184
where am i and why am i here				478.87205290250813

aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head				450.3078540462341

you can not understand the position we are in				568.9838457648418
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing hush said athos we are overheard in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still				8814.708425601522
so thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex				14168.235226452523
a lover is never terrible he said				316.15308409218227
to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit				89632.63904970413
d artagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away				532.5897594735948

you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake				15529.126071487326
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand				160.22828793735547
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters				5109.420376759499
all looked around athos himself stared				22067.88665928578

an instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings				14145.86371871774
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door				195.10541846266727

the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard				2425.3571566969167
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated château renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other				773.0582375312395
as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation				13459.424486554964
that is not difficult				15157.391675232326
you are a faithful friend felton felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner				870.7030055031355
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued				2749.7866935587485
the glance was of sublime eloquence				34982.24547547499
who are you and what do you want cried she				125.7322449619308

the three friends burst into laughter				2094.919072300724
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity				4183.671273418752
well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do to tell you all i know was the reply				671.4986111168635

permesso inquired he				38.92854035606567
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule				8362.257037539846
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother ah excuse me then said d artagnan				81.29454510774404
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded				95022.70548737468
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted				3284.5215722722905
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied				20707.564688505845

suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pele mele the intrenchments with the fugitives				10221.633224728303
a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality				4863.424694724067
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment				6437.101014739089
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended				13259.275463163976
the breakfast hour arrived but m de villefort was not at table				646.0307671539604
never planchet				517.1983400390374

the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed				8946.606174862321
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table				671.5946766346796
i have now been six years with m noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man				120.84358375349083

be silent i will write aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d enfer				110453.87863492568
have you really no desire to meet him none whatever replied eugénie				3000.9188763414527

ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief				5429.1758149986135
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved everything shall be done as you say athos				128.3125163855196
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful is it still only an intention your eminence asked d artagnan				58.189807626443965
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here here i am my friend dear athos cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation				6738.018976039675
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death				441.92145558989233
guard her				125.84572874707676

and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion				63674.08782366762
ah dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried				2067.079580296879

counting his treasures replied the governor				2439.383116931819
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric				21750.010893200637
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested				123078.09837100384
yes and who is the man i do not know why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you oh said the countess to franz go with all speed poor young man				113.51457123020596
it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles				1869.006185557002
hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man				108.69613036825595
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited				7997.201314983283
unfortunately i didn t crush him flat				192781.82430938547
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes				2550.675104343389
how was he going to find athos				42.803512573130945
when i was at rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became master and everything went ill				11928.779601532515
kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should i do so why you said answered mademoiselle danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals bah said cavalcanti crossing his arms one has friends the brigadier advanced to him sword in hand				157.93595125060958
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman				74390.5302377304
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart				310.0608977477721
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves				3139.1527618763066
where is he waiting below in my carriage seek him at once i hasten to do so the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again				250.4385012860079

you are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry iv				1016.226452905365
we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it				58.59683109749072
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past yes well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some time then scarcely longer than eight or ten days and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days				1701.574231661914
oh mercy mercy monsieur what i require is that justice be done				925.0760460183324
did the sun shine in my eyes and she leaned against the window				532.2498174605511

replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back				1068.8682929968593
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				150313.56444452808
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing				102272.15867969007
athos s idea cried aramis and d artagnan at the same time				320.7046759697035
a young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that convent				1829.847092177374
but now we must part				4811.442124902833
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade				178820.73438516774
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine				94303.10634579457
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage				128191.07442710627
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint méran arose from her pillow				12123.161061174531
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge do you then believe in god said caderousse				600.9629853897699
did you not see that at that name the young man stopped more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business a quarrel asked athos				86.97518968211422
it was nine o clock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour				1382.5022383820376
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into				17152.0531274656
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon				2516.0662912127377
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger				4881.081537507483
he was not long in making his toilet				6737.190089069533
athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him				31.73447596624316
my hand said she				140.52165629506626
at blois d artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal				401.20040259739386
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances				5921.099218996277
taste of this it is a spanish wine which our friend athos thought much of at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed				10815.456798746643
oh we can scarcely say				658.2886900338913
think of it madame he said if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands she listened panting overwhelmed crushed her eye alone lived and glared horribly				9101.953284327765
how can you tell me that does that alarm you cried d artagnan				8.821197576563067
who calls me i said mazarin with his most smiling expression				3092.1916764156526
keep the francs you have left i give them to you				68.3396527669347
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied d artagnan and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account				2046.0810206384563
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart				319.0110964528741
more pale and menacing than athos d artagnan stood on the threshold				4515.907328789506
gentlemen said athos a wager ah wooi a vager cried the swiss				6017.877208267316
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked d artagnan				25.50322251200296
they returned to the hotel at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight				3378.1965290162393
good said he our syndic is at his post he knocked and the door was opened				2615.810974506234
yes and that s all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail				128459.69980272042
come do you know of what the count of monte cristo is capable				6824.443947217038
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor d avrigny				1593.6931498943004
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous				139526.81939301026
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me				69.94146860980324
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded				26345.288238727284
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven o clock we will then terminate this conversation				717.1800462134452
i will come and ask mine at eleven o clock this evening				697.474060949999
ah come in come in monsieur d artagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too				699.4357197138033
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor				566.2804179654345
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them				78.96978292910339
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations				32013.647641264288
but these francs here they are and more besides				33494.16456733507

is he still in a fit said the procureur				7363.658255265399
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms				18769.325083709817
have you a carriage no that is of no consequence i always have one ready day and night always ready yes				940.6085878097845
felton abandon me				46.9682819954838
the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings				3816.5558734444076
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse				234.068789327159
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger				2840.5897492202957
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment				381.016061286653
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have it a sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl				1317.3523071262534
i charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest sweetheart the letter bore the signature not of charles king but of charles still king and let him be no longer king cried the queen				434.6408731234061
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chief s consent did the same				1015.3260279922714

he extended a hand to raoul and said my young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions				3591.855697707444

rest yourself mother he said				255.3152523716297
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles				8604.630200166843
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said come despatch the dying shall you go then albert asked franz				598.1027658902186

i saw madame de saint méran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said château renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body				1245.249770652972
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album				80698.65382172535
aramis returned home and athos and d artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire				11475.887654525553
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you				76.27257159798634
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room				91.61227327260488
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you				75.43175643491843

let us talk of something else said he				17.23914639057321
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look				725.3658300465861
yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq héron villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again				272.3543088250957
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse and here is danglars who is a wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong				3392.3467900178875
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort				283.8982323357221
of course you stopped at your father s a feeling of faintness came over villefort				273.53568139745016
he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself				153.44868374873545
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring				67210.79421731106
so i will not abandon this bouquet pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole				9370.974676061662
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin				478.9412461295851
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips				414.2188126690724
pardon my frankness dear friend				163.44188461706102
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence				510.4978222156417
pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer				1117.021640997239
never that ring is defiled d artagnan sell it then sell a jewel which came from my mother				1090.4182071376872
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized stripped and bound				124265.29868593437
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded				75610.01886557815
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place				461.5045534252665
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth do you propose to me to do so d artagnan decidedly and honestly on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon				2260.734272105306
if his eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my musketeers said tréville the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known that i demand an inquiry in the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges i believe a young béarnais a friend of the musketeer your eminence means monsieur d artagnan i mean a young man whom you patronize monsieur de tréville yes your eminence it is the same do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel to athos to a man double his age interrupted tréville				900.904344457609
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative				98715.394440697

louis xiii like every weak mind was wanting in generosity				14910.406095797298
four in the king s room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered				921.0346219644905
at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic				64174.040691846225
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet				549.8500764368822
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to francs a month it is magnificent				6516.837860206669
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry				59686.68954621887

a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon				2471.621519129021
he continued so i was going away but he called me back				888.6283111970091
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said				357.1026043335849
though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh bicarat wished to hold out but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield				7043.674195367483
yes i should expect so besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them the queen s voice				204.51689281942356
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place				467.42670050936186
he could not understand how albert s fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation				14288.157918628922
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be hungry that s pretty good when i haven t eaten for twenty four hours muttered danglars				416.73983076779564

the chevalier murmured charles				6275.524977039705
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				86696.73876865109
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman the punishment of death replied lord de winter				714.1571927405361

i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days				1698.7319315731015
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron				21997.45452186581
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes				2552.229954078373
you see mercédès said the young man here is easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again well repeat it repeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it				50.85823726935208
they must be enemies he is right said porthos battle				6458.352047300706
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse				3778.3310074596307
and what does he say asked porthos in a self sufficient tone				891.2198078510174
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table				670.1155121774506

it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m d avrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime				3845.979632493161
this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare				14644.355153527846
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass				1075.1449633490708
ha ha ha she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless				4412.819623423247
stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising you still owe me something i said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me a louis on account a louis on account for a fowl certainly and your excellency now owes me louis danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke				164697.0088538124
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed				4652.632755503004
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks				20543.10592269878
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself come and sit down close to me said milady				434.88923305126764
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them never fear there s ten o clock striking at greenwich groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich				5729.552974523204
sinbad the sailor humph said the major very good				2919.3505023512867
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray				607.09697852586
the duc de beaufort				1319.5722173416948
in fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of february				10409.309784857818
reverend sir you lie				53953.85989202416
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body				1253.7244240592836
you may be overheard yes you are right i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness but what do you require of me then				784.8315977557605
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall well made				2571.7714869946917
thanks d artagnan thanks cried aramis almost in a state of delirium				4946.579500723605
i confess this staggers me and it has staggered everybody				5892.359220156365
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation				9784.098607869053
and now good night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening				686.8879987046868
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said d artagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are yes here we are said porthos				149.6176954301053
what said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after another d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach				88727.55781442078
yes yes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness				2333.5411785275305
your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects				2917.1198911258675
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room				92.85895012068846
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain				860.7026414945311
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs				66982.48403530006
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips				407.6762079409525
it appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger i remarked it				56.689449609134485
do not seek to know how i discovered it i know it that is sufficient				6820.409995840016
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish half past seven had sounded				2155.1010649407376
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother				1099.5748357920627
m coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities				99093.06095845104
la ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince				732.1196286784437
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat				2633.5754250856066
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard				2439.536662647793
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase you followed him cried athos				90.0804227986616
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue				101261.65649795615
tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother				956.0845728967294
she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them madame said villefort believe me a fortune of francs is not so easily renounced she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent never mind replied villefort i say that this marriage shall be consummated notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack				5424.776582595452
yes sir he said in a softened tone				823.7830791729256
now saddle the other three horses do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece said planchet with his shrewd air				692.8413551802424
let us go then said athos				10.046305568292581
the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude				1391.0848953635427
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras				155087.98721372697
the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that mme				177.63415456525084
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study				860.3185787667403
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair				304.35737631673135
but not before one o clock replied d artagnan				3.8599008207056418
noirtier resumed m d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m				711.5106899157345
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone				899.7563670839326
the morbleus the sang dieus the morts touts les diables crossed one another in the air				706.885864786572
be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber but my lord go sir i command you at this injunction from his superior felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his bosom				3656.7339915044977
very well sir said comminges you shall hear of this anon and you of me sir said louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest friquet and nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects				37900.40132181192
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one				1191.227813233352
a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat				28739.81994504757
on guard milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy				117046.5720847327
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief				1337.8175106885653
dantès saluted villefort and retired				1196.0994452474313
are you not rich yourself my father s income is about francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society				4927.938424622966
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons				48518.91938083037
go he said go my child edward ran out				317.8618030912247
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst				88287.29046862935
could you have believed such a thing possible why you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself certainly not returned danglars				375.1175404394235
so much the better				1004.1749129461801
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince				753.0898990026574
this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the allées de meilhan				13791.988863258684
in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor				1072.327443714059
i pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me				63.585031080526036
all the ladies rose and there was a profound silence				470.43460528415636
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak				1600.4846544522054
albert beauchamp and château renaud remained alone				875.9270925606152
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne				68813.05178853589
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself				904.1069926859328
then said the coadjutor this evening at ten o clock and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion				3785.775537406785
d artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner s hand saying eh				6596.165752185249
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme				180.1389408888716
it appears the conquerors had something else to do well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man porthos nodded in sign of agreement				1963.1075349416537
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects				3046.726240557259
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her				149.35751894861673
i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses				3772.332680653487
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education				162912.56634881615
i understand you fernand you would be revenged on him because i do not love you you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk				134250.10993289706
spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate à latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena				119360.68646382008
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès				330.75274344028367
port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by d artagnan and himself				188.40862260965102
he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it				60.939315433227634
grimaud alone was calm as ever				2058.4278682797762
beauchamp was in his bath				76215.82709330406
here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther and as d artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself				197.4765287916659
morrel looked attentively on villefort				239.77741505991463
the parliament condemned charles to death as might have been foreseen				7043.203995080157
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate				2626.795385095028
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hair those three marks of race				94453.14630803977
what ails you my dearest father				793.8955355098067
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly				9025.886288729032
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another				564.4493847101269
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean				77279.66089967567
yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology whom i sometimes consult about my studies athos smiled				288.74543828441864
that s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread				47075.95639258842
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray				4627.215753519112
this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not nearly so well monsieur do you know who this great lady is no i have heard porthos speak of her that s all do you know who this pretended duchess is				4167.797881330434
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence				987.2706246698212
there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand				25481.98873826947
m de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter				4037.834998493537
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed				320.46757867736864
pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master				1058.420363147323
you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you ah said villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i now again warn you then you yourself are one of these marked beings yes monsieur i believe so for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine				1145.579482165726
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand				18421.29036269161
five millions on five little scraps of paper it must be seen to be believed you do not doubt it no you say so with an accent stay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself				761.3903280763016
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement				15371.995486724896
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé d herblay of whom you have often heard me speak i remember him monsieur come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen				907.5901708068927
ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible				601.0661563783234
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god it is possible have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment				213369.27086928036
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory				66451.9056550981
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him				31.951795986296712
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face				317.88908655948717
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again				273.12174295905226
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself				2557.0440650603646
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you but on what day will this ball take place asked anne of austria				2896.1955033136765

no matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him				27.297942490507722
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale				880.3828626088693
two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company				2760.331868084998
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late you see said athos pointing to mme				104.0179206344245
for heaven s sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me				78.7484896168292
the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait				3478.899883641223
a ray of joy passed across m de boville s countenance yet he made an effort at self control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum that s no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act				983.4647639588848
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart				314.2002487700235
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story what else have you done after having lost my own horse nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours yes but you stopped at the idea i hope no for i put it in execution that very minute and the consequence said d artagnan in great anxiety				2210.058341009203
of course said he of what else should i speak mr				5597.004164780343
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down				738.7837583676653
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a parti colored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue				1042.3877716024133
he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently				24995.51011471049
in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously				176484.9338909387
i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy count you prolong my agony then said the count your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request				3440.403105990221

i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square				4875.656868332829
and you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life				487.551954559789

ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow				3862.5865585389283
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy				66788.82643924469
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life				396.0021194131063

on my word i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen how did it arise				255048.79707993608

it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it				61.0126732132656
she renewed the order relative to the gascon but as before she expected him in vain				910.3736969498182

a servant entered summoned by albert s ring of the bell				4222.54039382683
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain				1594.7117843248266
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy				933.1391967004508
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle				15756.985385987326

i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery				106069.7027760651
d artagnan i am ready to follow you and i also said porthos				31.400538029530072
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not come out of it but fly like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks				5463.878234232463
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at boulogne i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness				3228.83882085217
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence				71938.78743035419
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces				55314.359058314316
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another				545.7443956610689
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry				9114.696194916574

grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak				1543.639107314393
grimaud is it thou grimaud signified that he was not mistaken				2832.090818761938
maximilian s avowal at the same moment m de villefort s voice was heard calling from his study what is the matter morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self command and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge				6420.284023387063
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way perhaps replied d artagnan				28.30398359322567
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night				523.1816376582209
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her				147.153540636056
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands				404.6284606663
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own				693.3734591339453
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me you wrong me my boy now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone knowing as i do the goodness of your heart				309.34702089169014
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				94386.06237490058
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go				1357.7910954934368
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob				236518.60641955756
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw everything				400.35533315315826
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me anything well then my dear count present me to your princess i will do so but on two conditions i accept them at once the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers i give you my oath that i will not enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not				395.03197577413346
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded pooh said caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said cavalcanti				1642.089295041087
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat				2596.636757923426
by my soul said aramis she is charming				2735.3790749654004
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day				294.80794769482435
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet				972.5740648700494
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal				406.526623656006
a physician was sought for but none was yet found				23325.211127051378
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity				91064.81477342456
go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you				53.30415993496927
a blasphemy				100407.9216141869
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				1674.7465030942526
and her son florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same come this way monte cristo took bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward				4337.169007426688
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn				842.4929702698388
your eminence may be certain of that the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately				1645.5342289561422
the blade was round and of flexible silver				3897.9744227835345
and a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff porthos said aramis athos has already told you that you are a simpleton and i am quite of his opinion				3623.9163789350755
m de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king				539.6028862590317
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus				1371.2177263839142
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces and what will she do now asked the young man				88.28542967809466
really if the house had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off				1674.3073409344142
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy				4448.66421523899
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started				2234.70705106958
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated				3540.663966011139
she had fled with him from her convent with your brother yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death				439.81125659933036
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men				877.0864884853726
the hapless dantès was doomed				68580.73772007815
now mousqueton he said i hope you don t mean to desert your master ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army				1107.3067484499143
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen				445.98445608209516
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in oh my god				439.95892310149446
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then				904.6391412056449
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them				81.48953021213289
zounds lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed felton blushed				2471.440027401711
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her son s arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count				249.257856846713
sir my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you i make a hasty resolution said morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed				19667.532762984676
come do you really think you have anything to say against me				65.44093971998291
athos smiled				296.6555317760866
after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind				675.1027635423582
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her				152.6686318527619
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened				3773.671216639601
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million				16509.509981723448
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure				2134.8242476259315
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed				1907.8530394325794
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill closed door and the door reopened				134889.34882604366
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost said d artagnan				6.817118884263845
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy it drives me to despair said fernand				3156.5614923398157

what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt				20921.589032354786
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her monte cristo started				2236.956580304053
but d artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship				113983.42987840099
has this woman been relating her crimes to you				65.87084824107876
but i dined at m de villefort s and lawyers always give you very bad dinners				70019.59288672401
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared				401.306783535179
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble				8894.948680147303
and i a plain chicken said aramis				17.94529830739358
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages				7599.362383557048
i could not have killed her by the same blow i should have fled from my country dear albert said beauchamp				349.752713447812
they advanced towards a boat which a custom house officer held by a chain near the quay				3776.137236559245
he laughs best who laughs last				4203.8486168919
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear				967.9165860913834
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague				9030.139521964156
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes				8980.174741364084
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais d artagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation				715.4640045843856
how many men think you you could collect together to night two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army				1101.2313546879875
the injured man had recovered his senses				3531.151265579441
my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks				4591.898332445509
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it				61.06835372386684
i live because it is not ordained for me to die				984.6021621297646
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage				2789.573003888685
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going				2965.169463894644
i am lost				578.9046983071601
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will it was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres				108637.69187069187
tis true				817.0925532713662
upon my word you would make caesar afraid the matter is replied d artagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman and you complain of that said porthos				39.01428236211841
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life				485.98521780433856
these francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased				854.1589511526992
i have eight men on guard you know				726.8099368941764
he was dead				641.6601974055645
i have promised you the truth i will tell it were it to destroy me the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried felton				1192.986569384979
give me anything you like it is of little consequence go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints				66546.08193729648
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart				325.823548411562
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he can not offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husband s money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him				30.418420451890558
albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner				1021.2420215206334
the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more the governor laughed				4236.941028356494
i can not consent that this woman should die thus milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope				1502.9613879441163
why should you meddle with what does not concern you the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation				726.2061163711401
it is not very difficult to say tell us then d artagnan we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to france				675.5932167588128
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage				2521.1968637121486
proceed said the president				1184.130592108395
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench				101609.03615632858
he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company				2699.0413456086007
good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another				562.713079730216
you have two unruly prisoners there sir unruly comminges smiled you wish to terrify me i suppose				5078.131364592832
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king s room followed by his companion charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night				520.2622541038926
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door				176.1387084788919
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself ah ah				275.20913501158304
well what responded franz				254.54164921084728
i tremble to give my permission listen valentine				382.75034156744846
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever				2215.809227132661
at the language you use what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling				570.3112967177933
oh lackadaisy				886730.4162544978
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act				990.9570072672415
the letter is here and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom				3510.6921708960776
the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the st eustache church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling				2409.862342106667
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo				197.8275076059616
our duty is fulfilled not yet said aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i can not say before the queen chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor				839.4421307944518
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal				400.8772235634336
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road				1275.8953253614557
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered d artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen				370.4931574691706
well at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means				2074.214246641252
at this demand d artagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moment s audience of m de tréville a request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due season				10272.135803438014
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted				4432.478602432229
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner				862.5058391790913
bonacieux where art thou				17461.381070086583
would not one say he was speaking of a religious community				37446.84708483581
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb by your father s tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death				416.12664411996076
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool				11116.95788882707
not locked he cried that is well and he entered the little room in which edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night				523.8511507778834
d artagnan looked attentively at the building				10433.639693776726
he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert				648.443608222799
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long night				518.5199326529627
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running				94675.80979493706
this evening m coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for him				27.260759676386833
i mean that m de monte cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there neither of them there repeated madame danglars her staring wide open eyes expressing her alarm				2499.061117373705
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived				30926.297244662303
you go to madame d aguillon s and you pay your court to her you go to madame de bois tracy s the cousin of madame de chevreuse and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady				3592.4346471901995
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible				2028.8837637343054
the two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone				911.6291107875039
where stammered morcerf				920.9885088480605
shoulder muskets				3709.5189851276127
it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin				19026.102353433114
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker				14982.860154829576
well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part i am indeed rejoiced said andrea				1358.076001289059
the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela				15725.160260276216
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire				1676.1030433495675
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger				2789.402747060401
aramis shuddered				3164.636481735398
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness				4266.121699194555
i will repair it indeed i will my dear porthos besides what did i ask of you resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship				24974.49421256411
he then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness				7133.890376893878
you do not know her replied the stranger				3698.8329456568035
this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience				16973.984090987826
ho said he good advice advice of a friend				273.78400610015154
officer chapter lii				93295.59527276013
and you can not deny it added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice				1804.4680637194122
ah she cried what a frightful dream villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream				1401.3075675202144
well then a good journey to you said caderousse				204.05818042958546
i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen				2947.6887975355676
i gad				735136.552259208
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously				126627.66292785875
where does your highness wish to go to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case i m your man i can trust you you are a true frenchman i am an old soldier of rocroy my lord here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy				15166.587980731372
what would you have me say give all the information in your power tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little have you served under the usurper i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation				2357.958702303241
be punished alone for the first miserable man said lord de winter to felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea but i swear to you by the memory of my brother whom i have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable				8059.908769205597
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions				3967.526805383879
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle				5111.009131410008
danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for				626.2927449168463
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise				1660.1627923348526
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse				282.5727832501407
let us come to some conclusion				22280.56028136242
i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin				62629.78618638133
he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside				2937.685518541991
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m de tréville s hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship haven t i chapter vi				3273.795117448089
no you undertook to do so true replied danglars the french have the superiority over the spaniards that the spaniards ruminate while the french invent do you invent then said fernand impatiently				4263.766693332421
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan				72.20849548150707
what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo				164.3166233166925
i can t leave you alone in this abominable country thanks my worthy friend				284.88953730223386
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				29.390037769190307
as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris				361.95659990758645
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandit s wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor				891.0999752928411
then he must be playing in the garden go and see no sir madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch				1479.1486910212072
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this				1017.060747957966
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville i did go there well she was no longer there but she had left her new address where was she guess i give you a thousand chances how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight				4189.23284154391
i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye				1990.5753737866607
so much the better				1004.1749129461801
another gasconade murmured the gentleman				679.0273143471172
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment				436.520148611739
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty				2715.903347991075
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding				45114.75896252666
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies				1264.9585186840109
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself why do you ask me that what do you wish send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body and you will find traces of poison no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies what do you propose to me d avrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my house impossible				2417.9818252552936
you will find in the same way four relays on your route				3782.1776824150033
i respected your father very much said he				17.531100561696928
this man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice oh reverend sir since you left toulon what have you lived on				931.1310519103832
but let us return to business yes i was going to say if i were in your place well i would realize how would you realize i would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six months i would decamp well well said andrea that isn t a bad idea my dear friend said caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice you will be none the worse off physically or morally but said andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me				68.94175806025538
what must come is written monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening quite the contrary planchet the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy then that is monsieur s determination undeniably my friend				324.8499366408127
well what are you doing count to a former lackey				5917.503299591093
dantès cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven				542.9763338223845
go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet i have finished mine seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon d artagnan but he had too strong an adversary				2105.0376714252493
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon				2375.4169000213337
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you aramis does the same to porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you				75.29997459057901
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain				3705.929984370232
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz				596.3650193455474
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him oh father i exclaimed you are very good but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me				71.51866725355944
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so				289.7207870595488
ten days passed away thus				1382.8793684778336
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey				8015.190081777438
what were you saying to this youngster my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day s events are very like those in the days of the ligue of which i heard so much in my youth				1074.2768526069192
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his apartment				447.5363924309585
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen				982.5020069854471
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues				6467.036143265244
i heard it from m debray who was present at the explanation valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer				1226.5058683092193
to whom then to your new master who and where is he he is here and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydée in a tone of chastened anger				1290.253308881202
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down				754.5096855986396
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines and planchet dined by sleeping				15341.53316513444
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris				328.91684807812067
everything considered you are very well off here				598.5124499242729
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison				1933.4060825657639
thanks my brave friend cried milady and when shall i be avenged tomorrow immediately when you please milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan				152.48318228151763
what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall i ring				1567.702674208712
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see				1351.4190469312418
have you seen anything they asked				822.9389696151063
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life				461.69142432790204
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of or livres				962.9447822614678
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt				131575.90790856208
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again				233.42978755900407
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz				513.1636827113232
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men				879.1520327641618
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table				667.3521268656019
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too				632.4867979225934
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach				2278.8337694457246
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity				2015.6123840969335
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing				92876.2292889338
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival				3061.0844995104994
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary				87709.1563319645
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me oh				910.6003253569952
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis				3105.842892627612
go now at once or i shall have you put out i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty				5369.594391186618
one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance				17582.71426838918
come there can not be too many sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m de monte cristo s friend i was not sure but i thought it might be so				325.7955839522015
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint méran s				764.8676382308317
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads				1947.8007895948174
he had us in his power and he let us go				1251.884482546891
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box				880.320314740781
you are laughing at me i understand				1815.3257625290746
let us then take advantage of it then aloud well my dear la ramee				558.223535455828
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen mazarin listened intently				12002.530845968622
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen				3282.9495019520223
my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire				52012.36289174194
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior				82159.7297361356
he can turn his coat inside out you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice d artagnan smiled				302.9664560273679
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness				1707.6093597126517
a man can easily be put out of the way there then it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and one nights				3277.478184011066
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man				128.63597584919944
at length milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence				524.8913155416498
from fifty to sixty musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for anything				1066.2985419776635
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him				31.03684173830165
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck				1482.529587932814
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage				572.7796343660644
the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable				4413.189977524632
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt				1923.674898478721
in one case or the other the trial was soon over				2252.65295471612

zounds he said i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee				569.390960303107
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp				421.2559251392758
the boat continued her voyage				2542.6022323295215

at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert s mask fell off				1684.0855013871444
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard				138765.1236436686
the guide held the door open				3609.967085573957
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders				1171.017199961789
relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wife s story to see if the two recitals tallied				87932.69179317374
have you any friend whose clock is too slow well go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine				3292.9082021805825
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond studs				3760.69810799325
albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity				4633.57905156042
mercédès and albert were in that room				95.76650732458027
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army				1101.431439021907
olivain he exclaimed what do i see below there a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded				1974.1825609863395
i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us i pray you the baron went out sobbing				19885.784152468827
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation				745.1748215932907
the englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles				1882.7759731603196
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone				866.9801478073182
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips				414.3930574683737
with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and i will get you the torch you ask for				575.9033578521437
a young man we can sketch his portrait at a dash				59997.376894656736
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead				937.4482749602982
but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him oh				934.7067550382692
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did				2175.316327502999
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx				9727.048849317975
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb				143939.81439261328
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience				2475.772356780349
she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches				41291.78804205321
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count s enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english				4025.9843204077706
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another				557.9111255642662
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis				139.8085852119839
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission				12259.901839362423
i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan				2609.6166657346844
begone then d artagnan saluted m de tréville who held out his hand to him d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude				1405.732648423543
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened				1119.732854654304
my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom i saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived himself				174.63228475379157
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade				7682.879472555195
i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope				2012.403842377888
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture				57455.44345178245
there are four men come to arrest me				38.788496922878366
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees				4346.315607396553
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune				4509.340077054506

m d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m d épinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort				274.55586155947606

the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood				3560.9750902959195

he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage				2854.983782390661
and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation				732.993952251018
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man s debts and buried him decently and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone				5207.90950389427
see if he is still in the same place athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole				65091.3920033705
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m de villefort chapter				273.4204038276365

ah if i knew				4812.965764292118
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud				835.9645408211264
it seemed like the fête of jack o lanterns				206128.62492346085
do you remember me said he to the host who advanced to greet him				28.203223858923508
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile				402.74914687632423
for him those ten minutes were very long				2725.4919020552984

deuce take it				40.60476063887493
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said				275.04344149410764
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm				1661.2254961663027
let d artagnan speak said athos you know he always has wise advice to give clearly said d artagnan we must go where they will not look for us				251.06982475773665
i have already told you avenge him on whom on his murderers how should i know who they are order them to be sought for why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel				4699.832793920449

speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty s throne				11518.2762543856
i want to be enlightened on a subject then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw be enlightened said athos phlegmatically				20102.201084163753

and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimaud s laconic reply				636.839218544084
franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace				1966.1502869344547
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness				5219.18605586091
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely you are eating horse eating what said d artagnan				65.26944551326652
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan				144.2628196008293
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations				4398.307749021002
that will do replied the cardinal				236.2818624887505

she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors				59906.583545968664
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp				99301.2794294375
i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint méran has fallen a victim i did				2149.6707157314286
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit				4069.5623460302577
but dantès can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me yes and mercédès				3166.4870765567093
it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave				33655.86337871332
have i not my talent left				1330.476752882328
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear				4623.01221145644
come come tell me i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness athos said d artagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheard of story well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend				302.6674153174853
gentlemen and citizens set me free i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin				460.86791195549387
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me				69.46902475098159
pardieu said villefort he is a noble fellow				2208.1369762843938
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died				2976.889785650263
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos				129.9897965528285
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin just like the women replied d artagnan coolly				27197.60220684797
gaetano departed with the reply				643.3912441425512
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing				1575.3378807220445
from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard				3023.5382920243846
you raised the whole district so they told me very nearly replied planchet with a self satisfied air				772.3386521346176
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was satisfied				1632.0910755893772
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence				16920.067893188436
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense				65761.26325476039
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is yes i do sir in the donjon of vincennes yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission no no cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement				1202.6764252146463
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz				484.3126526647601
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out				384.7489110296973
yet he did not return home				1911.1017375139083
at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal asked m de tréville				917.8560388162989
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom you say either too much or too little speak madame				919.3260280446965
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot				73095.70431098569
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye				1991.2256684934137
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity				145007.19639952164
i have just killed an old friend indeed replied porthos who that poor count de rochefort well				537.3946139159452
oblige me by taking a seat said d artagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm				1512.8962793242742
what do you say said louise				28026.473035627758
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not certainly said morrel i am at your service count still what it is desirable i should know the real cause that is to say you would rather not no the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side enough said morrel who is your second witness i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel				4994.103250054975
i was looking anxiously for some iris roots i planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this morning				698.3759395393761
saved repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom by my grandfather				7221.2597587377895
every one according to his nature my dear d artagnan				5.446006736980166
that will do i will be there endeavor not to make me wait for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run good cried d artagnan i will be there ten minutes before twelve and he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him far				12557.377513446394
listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with weariness for four days i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for maximilian the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her				154.74152636062584
the hôtel then is far away at the other end of the town very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage				566.8504543621574
ah ah said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy the prisoner made no reply				637.6107000456756
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea				1425.5349113913608
andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues				16959.259717205005
like women not like queens egad				8241.441773742394
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune i do not think that m d épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss				13332.947003067924
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears				1000.4412676275764
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars				393.1846715593813
i did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile i came to touch and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed a letter				615.8519135652709
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter				1104.7599456083096
they walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal march				4713.84679288627
when you arrived madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed				1869.3502248947232
what consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase d artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel				4162.002794838948
a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end				1026.1683276179194
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received				2107.74152885903
then i shall be free i shall have an independent fortune and and what demanded morrel				460.2088870011789
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word				560.7328638804247
this affair made a great noise				4491.057358234816
albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask				3536.196115562943
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a troop				98049.14818034727
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				761.1195340792066
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible				2183.0442111656266
don t let him escape said a loud voice				159.07374275105192
porthos had been trying a new horse d artagnan was on guard at the louvre aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood and athos whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud found himself close at hand				160.35424923965502
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them				79.32760510406877
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes				377.6326183810275
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god				506.9890465684365
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible				568.3395719707906
a poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which i have sought so long rests on me for a moment				383.13051520599134
you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy				10124.219614607508
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged no you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa exactly that was the title then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was shut up there cried the pit in chorus				5877.525870058773
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air				700.4503464303883
to be imprisoned				71267.13220594688
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight				4705.016969996357
rochefort he exclaimed you				45.43365751212905
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée d antin to m danglars				451.6693226400185
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman				1007.1033768428949
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him				26.364777218068422
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule				8629.489235246723
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk				5912.94521227811
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely				79699.78652391484
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion				85011.0346480566
you know anne of austria the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go i am a dead man i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear d artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer				3100.885565759022
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him				30.974413636437408
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder				1429.1796133428172
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road				1229.3075398284839
but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my father s it was herrera				68361.59381809169
at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmonte s country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey				7509.93898511075
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go				1220.6148955464523
since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record				40994.84127453295
enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death				429.9698031886795
te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout france				691.9578421708608
edmond still heard the sound				10068.786891353122
then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough				1358.5533524331552
now then she said what next madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony				95082.26195229558
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him				30.52178162500824
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe				129995.51167269847
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud				661.1296019422402
on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property				3762.9690359743886
the procurator s wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived				168753.093481271
what will our two friends say				643.816599578509
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister my father said the young man bending his knee bless me morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you				65.84101581388404
you only know that this money exists				22728.69527993412
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen				4026.971187146605
pretty strong rum said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve				21333.274165355633
never fear said aramis				19.079666377082365
stand on one side d artagnan stand on one side cried athos				34.634609229118965
i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob go and lose not a moment				391.11244208145837
in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection				3192.086147910938
but what can be the matter				927.7822403693688
she had laid that down the preceding evening				673.3692323066209
the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in italy he confides him to my care				1155.340894680757
still though not actually received at the hôtel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess				98235.40370260327
my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious				130734.87603897166
it was empty and dantès emerged from the tunnel				35175.30645063504
sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning				1924.2033241346323
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there yes your majesty he answered trembling				2843.1617515387
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer				1622.5041672668763
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne				2014.763894764339
i m certain of it were it not for that i should thank you for you have worked for us				242.32208078220233
who are you cried selim				17411.64449936793
aha said groslow on account of political opinions				8869.248808331598
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them				79.04912572200834
listen it is impossible				2433.3884421157163
the event was announced by the cessation of the firing				4589.556071131426
the departure for belgium a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests				1907.9312782658342
you have never seen our africans count said albert				194.50210053120517
is that what you wish for said barrois				50490.63304029442
mordaunt was among these				3136.67194102607
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidly something vexes you is it not so nothing answered the baroness				1799.3325509636434
pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace				42436.64092494542
what battle does it represent that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i who has broken his				690.40617422884
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain				73910.7973917825
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks				6256.241692316139
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued				11998.15907727981
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand				160.4614095029985
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known				3169.8922178041294
near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken				1628.5251822225969
a moment later the gray headed man was beside him				28.22074576913272
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person it is my lord i have not named her interrupted the young man warmly				7741.460958692907
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity and will you make the same promise to my love cried d artagnan beside himself with joy				869.688473250929
i recognized monsieur d artagnan				10.541988947540766
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy five thousand livres per annum				35614.38789779009
i could interpret one of your looks then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown instantly but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service				1519.039218081535
he had but one fault he was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent				3903.4428301682296
at five o clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali				2922.836895641164
i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees				1139.2343428964778
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words				642.4543679658966
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble				1320.2916130467845
d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side				1110.3199412769482

this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple and at the third she expired at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone what are you going to say				771.1967250350226
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty				2435.909984482983
silence said d artagnan pressing her hand more closely				2923.429285491418
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome				894.9229909113685
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan who was counting on his fingers				3363.5535164129205
these young fellows can none of them drink said athos looking at him with pity and yet this is one of the best chapter xxviii				78241.70511312237
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice				1814.8627176886473
devil s coachman cried friquet you re meddling too				1224.6912726737075
now d herblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan				93.02092950703458
quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem aramis cast a glance upon d artagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws				12573.411158447136
it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads d artagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap				99384.36701764124
i hope so the friends embraced cordially d artagnan pressed raoul s hand				157.0700126788459
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever				2190.734780762486
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus				6245.481573391767
from the depth of my heart said gondy				874.8493203897833
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt				46359.01927034254
the breakfast chapter				251.60686102692884
comte de wardes not a word about the sapphire				11970.603296571735
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelings i have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins general said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fifty it is the privilege of weakness				3111.2858197018413
they were in earnest conversation				771.1787062180442
ah good heaven				570.3550816429743
do not fear pardieu we are alone i think i have discovered my father your true father yes not old cavalcanti no for he has gone again the true one as you say and that father is well caderousse it is monte cristo bah yes you understand that explains all				396.66432763270274
how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know because in truth albert you hesitate yes i fear you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you				47.68014510904439
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse				5374.774061360276
you are right sir said athos				10.741410448837538
i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks				4664.748464935278
the proofs the proofs said the president remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs the proofs said benedetto laughing do you want proofs yes well then look at m de villefort and then ask me for proofs everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails				7686.36789953783
one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence				506.5649506609086
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france				744.2593512758982
on the eve of battle				1047.808720217232
but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of d artagnan had not entirely effaced				96846.7882013202
what is the matter with my horse your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own				713.1420939174058
no well i shall see him to morrow and tell him about you but i m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos				55.65145903519523
pray continue well then listen				980.1165279253111
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated				3564.7500574411356
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment				375.5035614751174
certainly certainly cried franz				253.35434586795142
i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken whom do you mean asked aramis				58.98751556505407
so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness itself yes you will much oblige me go into my study here and i will show it to you and they both entered m de boville s study				868.4423645916753
their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything				1066.8579845276931
have you forgotten anything said aramis				18.16550471479666
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis				17.272083538539032
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him tete a tete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade				76128.5822890809
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say				691.4696866490682
i would have saved madame de saint méran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living				3177.2346149349164
what the devil do you want with a member of the parliament				906.7129319597132
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am				1481.2972228824565
excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend				342.74526219261975
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word				571.1955328025674
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper				62513.78170682853
you then served louis xviii and you did not show any favor it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself				191.23313943837516
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin				351.4197549116921
this moment come my lord said d artagnan				4.35724156920768
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor				1204.7835169254308
athos raised his sword d artagnan lowered his				786.4447172233234
never more to be separated why as to that i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life where are these papers then here they are andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents				10705.010462225811
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground				990.6451897549105
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said d artagnan				60.246527668969065
the king s authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed				683.640668894979
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort				275.63793447833757
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme				151.0730681267273
let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night				507.34769041453364
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing				58132.100204754264
is it to do us some ill turn				848.1845645388972
alas would i could weep like you and he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much				1615.8156856988946
eh said he showing it				45.36969494278366
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step				2116.448114684905
speak i beg you i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time				318.7956203969201
nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind				1569.571138931019
dantès continued his search				3293.074645571837
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us				251.1713673557718
this is a boy tréville a mere boy				1501.628260691256
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed				318.9123882194585
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage				578.9069066575419
what has just happened yes said the count you are right it is miraculous for albert is brave resumed morrel				493.84037314246405
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror				560.4056883707333
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation				9981.26008639994
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter				1082.165719799874
oh no self love beauchamp				381.00552384064656
the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed				2100.6978770295004
they fire like grooms said porthos				11.777610946021532
but i wonder she is not here				562.3834079792363
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis war for the king yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort monsieur de beaufort				918.2149966385958
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear d artagnan very good said d artagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there				531.5731189638356
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately the two friends went toward the shed				8651.45759014828
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared				399.1955545131621
at this moment a horse neighed				69156.79939519751
more dead than alive he looked around him				24.577000711970207
i present them but my correspondent has disappeared				387.35405354901377
i wish to thank them all at once				823.9952240910923
where is thy master you stand upon his property but how handsome thou art how fat				100753.04511890329
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him				25.32198529159347
raoul had offered some opposition at first but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army				1116.5013754305128
madame de villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared				401.12503461707274
we shall be alone and can make up our accounts in good time				318.73831642144927
they ask my age i tell it				41.473858951270145
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign				3469.4141569319686
she was a charming woman of twenty five or twenty six years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal				110710.98908977497
i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dantès				351.2033211516305
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am d artagnan don t you know me				28.08111574641763
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling				666.4769644709332
the tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage				575.2276595147653
m de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death				455.9665070202327
they entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder				3112.1523491348803
i go said he i go at once how you will go said mme				77.05574738543322
come porthos come mousqueton they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible				635.2133301964233
like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening s diversion he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day				295.54069225537995
yes it is so long ago answered porthos				11.440252765534284
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand				163.0234417399152
teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics				16512.59623050215
no my guardian replied raoul blushing				33785.752079216625
keep watch from seven to nine				5337.837023046733
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them				74.91183106869943
i should lose myself in the cardinal s opinion				3925.120013436998
adieu my dear cousin				18209.280501512992
they quickly went downstairs				8329.520643811478
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me				71.31526128240857
is there a house in the neighborhood asked d artagnan				4.1030130217981
he must be mad said the inspector				2184.2708025025513
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme				175.79795722366234
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean the pharaon come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study				863.7154232865021
no no				352.3795636443024
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain				1360.8978494247058
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard				546.2651063292635
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant				1368.7888748092757
what is it said the light horseman				14260.632190539958
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance				728.0024216946725
athos aramis and d artagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender				14751.768202622457
château renaud looked for a moment for morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count morrel had quitted his post and château renaud failing in his search joined debray and beauchamp				437.25261443091586
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos				35.62509340726964
ay and observe it just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the antichrist well said milady				643.7223588035157
lead us grimaud grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade				49677.18669223897
and this explains how d artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la chevrette				6068.7037239066
yield he cried or you are a dead man the musket fell from the soldier s hands who yielded on the instant				2131.5326578396944
he the man who would be popular can not forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned yes it is all from the same cause make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered beware morcerf he is already an old man i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally				10915.013194716992
they are aiming they are going to fire they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal exclaimed mazarin				323.99400168038756
we are for the king and the princes added athos				197.03191613849413
well i shall look upon it as an expiation ah said d artagnan i know what you mean and i too added aramis but you must not think of that athos what is past is past i don t understand said porthos				40.955203675714245
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least				2057.0718339096884
how much do you want all you have in gold i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts i have as much				1670.253333846923
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege				4054.1528286436687
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines are you a surgeon asked de guiche				3273.651502419486
on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beads she was in the costume of the women of frascati				49136.465678333014
she had still her nymph like form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with anne of austria over the moat of the tuileries in				581.0490997390854
everyone offered his own				733.7409046377486
we hope so answered the curates				403652.6203833218
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart				321.54149498378206
it was like a besieged town				6273.281075682237
march forward but eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv				1016.12324377102
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud				802.0362579215916
we are not generally very severe with the austrians				75833.37610482998
chapter lviii				5163.085801974193
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go				1343.328988290766
short and stout who is it they all asked together in a low tone				784.5861367626019
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away the devil				1292.4146119927807
sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them				76.45675103261844
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon				2413.3040894572205

at last as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and monte cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit				42023.27572169828
i read it a little while since				6875.581538307596
at what time six o clock where at saint mande who told you the count de rochefort some one drew near				2749.4576019343644
look out cried d artagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder				11700.778532250135
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others pardieu i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before me				69.89642633591511
halloo major				4866.547153577369
when d artagnan had finished he said hum				52216.780080098615
the host desired himself to serve him which d artagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation				734.695283835382
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				58712.1513933704
a black point floated on the sea				1029.3415396257813
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven				538.0217663989441
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk				87195.65714709599
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment				372.07165485376703
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				445.5597598253037
d artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop				1068.507503209247
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bed curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine				942.8934134881009
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote to mlle				112523.30579399255
i waited for him until this hour replied franz				349.51430636058575
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently				3577.8080223234065
i certainly never will get drunk again d artagnan it is too bad a habit d artagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me is it to your mind asked d artagnan				172.22369328481125
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight				79754.75899698508
i like men of head and heart				288.011550043265
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair				5562.421609039033
then said albert you became the property of this man no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople				27088.00359754941
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep				845.4782946019824
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend				329.1248833819151
these gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubt for since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed eh how can i tell				7060.299125702611
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house				407.5943757908274
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event				2623.9160908940626
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name				514.0664234751436
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best				5865.358283668323
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought				1382.7211195487141
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit				30044.254150187997
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				618.7781283233244
milady looked at this man and hesitated				1400.1113402179462
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this castle				1949.406389385453
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust				7863.911183296352
still more must be done				854.6474371574748
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him				25.68453213969128
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it				60.996499588349444
indeed said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy				3594.3365875083737
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers				61744.30048414442
then you will start after the queen no said mazarin again				238.9514003030823
noirtier s eye remained immovable				3298.958951342628
ali is the supper ready at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room				92.91475791742582
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction				2506.545108341386
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo				296.74381369099774
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received				2135.447332215965
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest				812.4211657696643
still five days before us				258.6131038977049
m noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m noirtier try noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself				195.59221789136708
we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament				913.0856441484661
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion what exclaimed d artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it				60.669528494478364
but the lady asked porthos				12.003496963197048
years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined				2993.415786307062
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes				8501.180212523936
ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely				3341.0498895178866
be one or the other but not both replied porthos				10.574787029530942
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman				21531.43356485984
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer				2082.535059954446
look closely the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald				46030.723816438745
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar				128108.33617306036
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber				17871.749848153864
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest				3308.8368354257764
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais that is all i wished to know said the queen				294.1269448500673
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument are you mad la ramee				551.6032388502682
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king				501.7306161742294
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion				21263.990136155997
after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only				4943.080408933043
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his eye was calm and even brilliant				8167.883427512597
the company looked at each other in consternation				18823.96311746021
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated i can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence				505.5613438933903
is our little neighbor worse asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth				866.9979245486103
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men				876.5609341277889
if he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him what to do with him answered the prince				609.7300506349193
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort				255.30685218766322
au revoir then that is all i have to say today				5331.935240742094
d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume				18051.79843512678
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank				3137.6981465280273
to know what the name of the owner of the winning horse excessively only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not				399.22677334272277
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions				1008.0508245701877
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked d artagnan				39.644118747245585
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans				4036.1756535619143
what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth				4106.118038738089
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter				762.6679149005098
d artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the same pace				5026.887603765306
they halted for the king to dine				12039.89303829655
quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair				313.9176611426038
he had a deep set penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast				1200.1403034391024
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made				2538.0367732550444
i name only the most important you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these yes i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek i don t speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself improve yourself repeated dantès why how can you manage to do so why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium				5500.496560199488
are you on the ground asked d artagnan				4.269471480809924
he determined to make two cardinals by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich men this was the return the holy father looked for				641.2105828879193
and yet what asked the abbé				464.05173868116924
on the morrow at three o clock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères				54715.096811972864
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated				58529.34186299444
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands				405.3870465919581
all that which a man wounded in his self love could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator s wife				884.086965605474
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side				1117.0759713358157
now said the old man aid me to bury my child carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose				1545.6277613063628
those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once				843.6950055046537
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince				730.2114852429321
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber				410.53289295662404
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere				53924.79598101838
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them i have not done so				313.7873103091221
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power				1806.9461025881799
i defy you to find him who executed it silence said a hollow voice				169.52273072471866
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made you insist yes i insist permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising				3973.236772716668
can all this force be summoned on my account thought he				100.78763220221799
ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finish one moment				389.05187608057867
come to me d artagnan began to be touched				6537.092689575323
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside and the young man went to the gangway				39061.81897531044
you think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said gondy				1250.687583328004
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window				532.2460105268095
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles				23868.539779422914
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you and monsieur du vallon added the other				751.5365947110961
can i be of service to your majesty said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity				1859.6337204865092
why three days ago the emperor had not landed no matter i was aware of his intention how did you know about it by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba to me to you and which i discovered in the pocket book of the messenger				1545.7515844078362
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore				1823.7564577461822
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporte ah is that you de winter				840.3776992981567
but don t sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep				844.529799062607
m de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed				322.7608787328421
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocer s or druggist s gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced then when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood				5242.467370683242
i know them by their romantic imagination				1977.2217369143088
why was not m de saint méran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying				10925.729691483242
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness athos smiled				302.91358620799014
the spade perhaps an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search				2528.085247175681
we must then as it appears to me travel in company				2889.590752546971
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust				8020.955640665744
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land				2962.804947478031
in the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded				3076.9567507859283
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person added caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantès faithful and attached friends and was he not so asked the abbé				667.2426687508199
arrived at the staircase it was still worse				4058.415776575005
an englishman you say yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome				875.4051548936017
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor				896.0314745116395
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta said the queen				330.0924190683909
pray tell me how it happened willingly				32093.339924176642
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor				2249.164675285413
d artagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him				28.676101662375288
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects				7079.157098615486
porthos bowed as if in assent				2681.3326162624935
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans				1500.5402861449609
your voice is that of a young man i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here				606.3155790695924
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking				2025.6569937645543
once again silence				433.6612579260195
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise				1617.6072759588965
it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly				3167.8553403116553
d artagnan then looked around attentively				54818.92981010522
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also monte cristo gently smiled and said i was there at the same time pointing to the corner of a street				1281.4070808171755
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in				583.4665265620455
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god				495.0248501154391
what do you mean cried d artagnan				4.534783223991289
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and m d épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart				3410.922182422962
very well my lord it shall be so d artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness				1685.3161997763473
the rendezvous chapter				324.25782752881565
you would expose the self love of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle but yet m danglars appeared delighted with you was he not				390.91256844496706

well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand				151.6211106820921

he has six millions worth he must sell them at whatever price why because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain how do you know debray shrugged his shoulders				1137.2928680154857

because we want to know said de guiche haughtily				6015.765591891866
you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon i hope have news that will be agreeable to you grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior				15825.144727307998
listen m d avrigny listen noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention				969.9689132879749

for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven				538.1249088898415
it is by his courage please observe by his courage alone that a gentleman can make his way nowadays				88464.78821441859
grimaud moved as if to leave the room				92.76636548017716

messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow voice				169.879181968055
onward cried the gascon				1925.5268597454124
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs				1281.8214210531553
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos				219.64499768385247
for pity for mercy s sake do not deliver me up it is too late they are coming said eugénie				2414.0763683048017
athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings				116968.01494482087
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again				247.42935025352858
i think only that i have known you not a whole year				633.7632202476007

hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmore s opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine				1092.178103206697
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion				7252.454965022535
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian				107032.9071041581
father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugénie danglars and m andrea cavalcanti				1267.7404198808597

dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m d artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not come				611.739473918582
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts				1866.551619595801
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty				4649.589902855208
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful				17418.354227280593
coquenard had seen everything				384.8373501548199
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him				24.48840521485472
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know tis true replied d artagnan				15.802351802837013
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities				80417.70045717194

you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain				884.6807291525776
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god				473.8950798449136
he promised to be back by eight o clock and eight is striking				19970.355779373156
the comte de wardes was announced and d artagnan was introduced				2246.3393800446115

one would think it had been placed here on purpose get on it that s it friend and d artagnan coughed				94350.24377474868
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss				4103.585233367506
this was their mutual declaration of love				924.1078740600196
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness you re a great moralist and that s the fact said porthos				90.122871045385
i have seen them before as ugly no but reasonably hideous what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar pshaw said de guiche				3216.0759424228945
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door				191.35336176655903
the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words				609.0291841859589
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces				12731.64776568568
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count				247.04325581312492
he turned and saw julie				7480.631971305087
one of us would suffice really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence and bernouin do i not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling				3869.6877873498393
so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box				909.984826421566

you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi pelagians but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head				456.6804261775108
d artagnan examined her with a rapid glance				5480.588589771122
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner				9234.264709925623

then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said				450.6448813041123
but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp i yes you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine ah yes so i was				539.169248229746

bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat				1279.452079596789
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you				78.5825051308536

the effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy				10408.039194711717
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back a step or two but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place				466.5693749839037

more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive				15723.78062610583
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them				78.2386383664975
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined				80281.15084889086

it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination				1386.1644798395293
at precisely six o clock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah				64137.75867938398
he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own				723.1086685105001
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind				637.9023377004289
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none				3850.941712598415
the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel				11756.234528802117

he would no longer be alone				871.2782246374792
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris when do you propose going thither have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties				4290.426671632019
athos porthos and aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much pleased				870.6519394244333
mazarin rose				3591.3864402709287

so you hate each other said the count				132.64270342824972
you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter				631.9935838399583
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied				1685.0084408886303
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living imbecile exclaimed la carconte				3333.608681025255
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m d avrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms				578.2152770167221
to come in the capacity of a cousin and seat himself every day at a good table to smooth the yellow wrinkled brow of the old procurator to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos				185.74066118905822

at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly				110069.43705634058
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened				1072.0258040599372
it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity				4702.841252091138
i don t understand said porthos				11.706910739393017
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo				232.7348152580298

the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward				1992.7064743493227
i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them				76.97532212022533
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me				66.95131168203336
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern				14505.719208410901
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop				6504.115880243091

notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain villefort rose as he perceived her				144.4310400524556
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern				9680.18622448161
grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm				1692.8387625651658

ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all				397.2012931036278
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory				1445.7360719745536
then m de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m de la trémouille to interrogate him himself				188.2752570887019
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses i have no horse said d artagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de tréville s that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine one of yours				1063.4403102420304

that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner				2852.836360610863
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures me				68.56310711403073
she must have spoken she must have confessed everything a woman is so weak				9329.59926716978
jealousy fury offended pride all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love urged her to make a revelation but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that d artagnan would also be lost to her forever				2082.008820500917
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him francs for a mouthful of bread				21087.026426222896
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs élysées to the house of monte cristo				329.9721871172618

keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man				131.55870557431973
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone				1396.4641893499645

as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				2586.948838264623
two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred francs repeated he				290.97221660168464

evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck				1438.9485572718131
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements				8207.886681159058
and you fellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte d artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop				1070.6255701759076

proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his father s or in his cabin on board the pharaon very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the king s attorney and that s all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke				6469.312331418462

only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty				2048.9729301867287
