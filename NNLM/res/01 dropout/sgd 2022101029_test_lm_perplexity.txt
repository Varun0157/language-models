anything else was to be expected				1158.6814717336242
once a queen and a wife				1101.7833815413862
cried porthos to his opponent i				233.63579820525905

quite an adept in the art				5924.465668582634

only so would i said porthos				33.43755917290139
diogenes designated as animals upon two				455.65439622284936
be worse than vanity to suppose				2230.8508101883804

that man when he said why				1190.4243336429413
if athos joins us well we				15.426673414505045
wishes to make a speculation in				15.553527952159726
and this state lasted till about				2990.793426118484
forgotten the events of the previous				2601.9440306444817
its hinges and d artagnan seeing				1400.4525382176143
at these cries all who were				19.930109081422252
a volcano but still no prisoner				6234.466454887371
so of your own accord you				69.94060149720895

imprudence as to try to escape				163.28235131141514
utter despair which chased each other				8.378257149409913
placed upon you i imagine and				54.77936332739099

ate these listening anxiously for the				4.571374906328259
suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom				296691.35085976176
