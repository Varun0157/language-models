fashion we had executed his commission				4409.979872439983
most delicate attention on your part				3245.144509540174
the grasp of porthos was all				453.4518092896908
doubtless you would commit great follies				33468.77988454186
so little like the one mercédès				3775.7843349510313
oh dear yes sir the abbé				1231.7989793404297

monsieur if you will at some				527.1673464171407
three days and whether there is				138.93460476641215
nevertheless do you think of escaping				52457.357995836974
the quarters of athos whom he				67.75030052672882
