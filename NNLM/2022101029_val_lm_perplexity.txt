at the door of the hotel				4120.14912905686
in this affair perhaps you speak				1468.5857326017597
that there have been certain things				3677.1112489677907
a very snug berth for a				30.37372103797879

what rank did he hold on				268.41033199150763
either wrapped in his mantle or				438.79697171400994
evident that under existing circumstances d				228.53606481348174
yes madame said monte cristo but				90.61108332622287
a maxim of poor athos the				118.15743803029886
you appear to forget yourself sadly				13515.905132338035
in the court of the palais				1130.297065934691
to a life which you once				4001.6009847539626
