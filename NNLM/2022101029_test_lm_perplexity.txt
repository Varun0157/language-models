this operation proved as great a				184.98573979704375
beauty that they were somewhat too				281.7877954445859

minutes after one is taken the				15.338591179543423
guard milady assumed the most agreeable				523.4960673868922
being dashed to pieces against the				4.308085835690981

fully promising himself a rich indemnity				177228.06418217055
much said mazarin giving a last				1311.562104017593
you have suspicions nevertheless yes monseigneur				794.67991821008
very tempting to you but if				111.66775745042636
a queen and in the day				662.7895882886747
night such a man of regularity				40599.972756220486
conceals at least half of his				8.738217759048645
name of the stoic we need				6777.718866973434
de morcerf so early had you				1280.6679568267477
he had passed a feverish night				285.7153165124757
have been myself to the best				249.8452180967852
the sensations he had felt when				311.80953603570794
men was simply a kind look				1216.360669586189
who have found out his merits				29042.317950142893
lent him to a friend who				18.062064385127876
he had never had to do				136.60808942165636
suspicion in his mind or at				129.40937673146234
hat around his head and his				29.55649933295807
there have you any one to				208.36862333029305
east where he has done much				305.856172622269

cloth arose then and urged by				367.9900067825876
as if that name sufficed for				40.69026537935959
i must go to paris ah				136.8073018029538
the very person concerning whom she				35.24232422777767
and leaning over her chair said				376.07715113241846
with the tips of their fingers				238.9520839495003
gentlemen were obliged therefore to get				240.33922731893873

upon him which make a slave				1089.1346819059413
scaffold the people all took part				3186.19495500595
perhaps this would not have been				4.894803948981666
has he says a letter to				11.249544775386466
known and they wish either to				11.609162120500244
this strange disorder fragments of garments				39839.15855309772
untied the cord and then the				12.191864681417574
hands of this worthy man mount				92970.87416414027
to obey the orders of the				2.2533636685773777
believe that we will not accept				2498.1818379359347

how does this misfortune affect you				5.828058164168767
minutes after m de tréville was				30.921398725850306

heard that shipwrecked persons had died				1893.8465682215806
which has made the cardinal so				87.4062464312484
any jewels hide them directly if				497.8579277455164
